        "When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the new film \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus\u2019s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as \u201cCarnage\u201d.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any \u201cwow\u201d moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5"

        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/free-guy-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Free Guy possesses a remarkable tribute to the gaming community, but it's the surprisingly clever, thematically rich screenplay that makes it one of my favorite films of the year. In addition to the impressive visuals, hilarious comedy bits, and thrilling action sequences, Shawn Levy, Matt Lieberman, and Zak Penn offer a brilliant narrative that deeply explores human nature and what the viewers perceive as \"real\". Superb acting from the entire cast, namely Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer, and jaw-dropping cameos genuinely elevate the overall experience. Honestly, it might be the very first movie to prove that Disney owning every major studio also has its perks. What could have been \"just a videogame flick\" is actually a nerdgasmic, super exciting viewing with emotionally compelling characters and an extraordinarily smart story. I couldn't recommend it more to gamers, but don't let my words mislead you: Free Guy is a blast of entertainment for everyone!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",
        "**Ouch and Cringe**\r\n\r\nThis \"Ready Player One\" clone is just as dumb and non-immersive as the original, only here we get our hopes up in the first 20 minutes or so. We get setup nicely with truly funny video game references, top notch CGI and clever dialogue. But then the flick degenerates into the same old, same old: boring villain, plot is unoriginal, action is magic, hacking is imagined by someone not owning a computer (probably just a smart phone) and finally, the philosophical idea of a first AI ever is not explored in the slightest.\r\n\r\nI know this is just supposed to be a \"feel-good\" film, but critical thinkers will not feel good watching this drivel. Something this trivial simply does not deserve a high score, even if it does what it's supposed to."

        "The latest film in the G.I. Joe cinematic universe has arrived with \u201cSnake Eyes: GI Joe Origins\u201d. The film was originally planned to arrive in March of 2020 but faced delays due to cinematic closures during the Pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a young boy being orphaned after a group of thugs kills his father. Years later the man is still obsessed with finding out who killed his father and earns a living in underground fighting known as Snake Eyes (Henry Golding)\r\n\r\nHis exploits get the attention of Kenta (Takehiro Hira); who hires him into his organization with a promise to help him find the man who killed his father.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSnake Eyes soon finds himself working on the docks where he smuggles guns into fish bound for Japan. Despite his misgivings working for criminals, he befriends a man named Tommy (Andrew Koji); who teases him about his demeaning work by calling him \u201cFish Boy\u201d.\r\n\r\nWhen Kenta forces Snake Eyes to kill Tommy for being a spy; Snake Eyes refuses and the two make a daring escape to Japan. It is learned that Tommy is next in line to run his clan and that Kenta was banished years prior and plans revenge.\r\n\r\nDespite mistrust from a trusted associate named Akiko (Hakura Abe); Snake Eyes begins his training in the Ninja Arts which should he survive will make him a valued part of the Clan which Tommy believes is correct thanks to his Blood Debt to Snake Eyes.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on various aspects of training before branching into the larger story of divided loyalties and honors which results in a few battles and chases along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does space the action out; it does provide some great cinematography and the action is entertaining even if it lacks much tension.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that the G.I. Joe/COBRA connection seems a bit forced as The Baroness (Ursula Corbero) arrives to move things along but it is mainly for the purpose of getting characters to do this and get that so the film can move towards the climactic action.\r\n\r\nSamara Weaving does show up as Scarlett but she does not have a very large part in the story and aside from a few limited action moments; she seems to be more of the token G.I.Joe representation.\r\n\r\nGolding and Hira are very good and their intertwined and complicated relationship is giving plenty of time to develop as their past is a large part of their futures and the film does a good job in explaining their past and future motivations.\r\n\r\nThe film blends Asian and Western film styles and in doing so creates an enjoyable film that for me was more enjoyable than the prior films in the series. To me those films focused mainly on action and this one was focused on developing characters.\r\n\r\nWhile it remains to be seen what direction future films in the franchise will take; it would be interesting to see more of Snake Eyes story down the line.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",
        "If you are looking for the G.I. Joe style storytelling and action this may disappoint. It's a very different style and kind of predictable in many ways."

             "This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography  is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia\u2019s bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.\r\n\r\nEverything else about this movie is\u2026okay. Okay acting, okay story etc.  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.\r\n\r\nI cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.\r\n\r\nI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.",
             "**They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.**\r\n\r\nI am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. \r\n\r\nThe best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.\r\n\r\nYes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.\r\n\r\nGosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with clich\u00e9 than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",
             "Undeniably well put together, and entertaining, even if it certainly chooses style over substance.\r\n\r\n<em>'La La Land'</em> is an absolutely gorgeous-looking film, from the costumes to the cinematography to the choreography. The musical numbers are pleasant too. It is a little light on story, not that it isn't entertaining - it is. They were, evidently to me, going for an artsy film and they nailed that. I just personally wanted more depth to the plot, rather than a song every few minutes.\r\n\r\nRyan Gosling is probably one of my favourite actors around right now, in the argument at least, and he is very good here. So is Emma Stone, who is arguably the film's standout. I wanted to watch more of Stone's work even before this, so I knew - along with Gosling - I was going to enjoy the cast. They work excellently as a duo. Elsewhere, John Legend's role is a tad out of place, even if it's good to see him.\r\n\r\n4*. It might make for lame viewing if you absolutely do not like musicals, but otherwise it's 100% worth a watch - even for someone with a mild taste for musicals, like me."

        "The latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has arrived with \u201cShang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe film introduces audiences to Shang Chi (Simu Liu); an easygoing San Francisco resident who spends his time parking cars and hanging out with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) and her family.\r\n\r\nLife is steady if unspectacular until he is accosted on a city bus by a group looking to take a pendant his mother gave him. When Shang Chi shocks Katy and the occupants of the bus with his martial arts abilities; he attempts to find his sister Xialing (Meng\u2019er Zhang); who runs an underground fight club. While Xialing is estranged from her brother; their father Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) has conspired to bring them and their pendants before him.\r\n\r\nTheir father uses the power of sacred devices known as the Ten Rings to rule for over a thousand years and destroys all who would oppose him thanks to their power and the army he has gathered over the centuries.\r\n\r\nWenwu wants to revive their long-dead mother as he is convinced that she is calling to him and he wants to be with her as he was able to be a better man and forsake the power and abilities the rings offered him.\r\n\r\nWhen it is learned that Wenwu plans to go to a mythical realm that their mother came from and free her or burn the place to the ground; Shang Chi must make some hard choices between family and doing what he believes is right.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an action-filled thriller with plenty of mysticism and humor.  The film has a very engaging visual style that combines Asian and Western cinematic styles which results in some very engaging visuals as well as action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets the film apart from many Super Hero films is that the characters have a solid base to them as they have a complexity to them in regards to their past and their motivations. Their relationships with one another are key to the film as family, honor, and justice are key elements to the film but they are not given lip service but are developed well along with their characters.\r\nWhile the final act may be a bit FX heavy for some; I found it in keeping with the story and the characters and the great Sir Ben Kingsley provides some very welcome comic relief in his return as Trevor.\r\n\r\nAwkwafina is also great as she provides some very laugh-out-loud moments but is not afraid to mix it up when the situation calls for him. Simu Liu was very enjoyable in the lead role as he performed the physical aspects of his character well but added a restrained sensitivity to his character as he is a complicated individual who is conflicted by choices he made in his youth and the ramifications of them now as an adult.\r\n\r\nThere are bonus scenes that set up future adventures well including one that will no doubt have Marvel fans heatedly debating when the film premieres.\r\n\r\nOnce again Marvel has shown why they have had such a sustained success with their films as they have done a great job again of introducing a new character to the Cinematic Universe but also connecting him to their cinematic past and future.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/shang-chi-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start\u2026\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

And what's more ...( trailers also )... if you're someone with 'even the slightest bit' of true passion for all things within the realm of sheer cinematic **-{ FANTASY \ud83c\udf20 }- ,** then you'll be absolutely -delighted- to know that Shang Chi -Also- has a distinct 'Harry Potter' aspect to it . . . & if even -that's- not enough for you . . . then, get this, its got a 'full-blown dollop of Narnia' thrown in there for good measure, at that. To be -Really- honest, it felt a bit disorienting , -At First- , seeing all \"those types of elements\" in an 'MCU' ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) picture, but then I suddenly realized that 'Infinity War' -And- 'Endgame' both -Very- prominently feature, well ...{ a walking, -\"Talking\"- demolition derby of a, err, -\"Raccoon\"- }... in them, & I began to feel at home again, pretty darn quick. \r\n\r\n**2. \" There -Is- One 'Stark' Downside, Alas . . . .

'yet another' archetypal, classic \"Islamist-fundamentalist\" type group.

        "The Suicide Squad...\r\n...stayed true to the hype of the anti-hero teams in DC.\r\n\r\nI feel like it wasn't really a sequel but rather a reboot and ignoring the first film.\r\nThe action was insane and BLOODY brilliant, with a stellar cast. And they LITERALLY killed off the first team at the very start of the film! To be honest, I wasn't really surprised as I didn't see more of them in later scenes of the trailer. But I was surprised they killed off Captain Boomerang - he was basically the primary member of the team! And I especially wanted to see more character build up with Savant, learn more of his backstory. Instead, he just turned out to be a totally wuss that's only good at killing small birds! But what shocked me the most was Rick Flagg's death!\r\n\r\nStill, Idris Elba and John Cena were fucking awesome as Bloodsport and Peacemaker, respectively. And King Shark was hilariously awesome. Funnier that Groot because at least he says more than three words - although, \"hand\" would have to be my favourite moment!\r\n\r\nI did had mixed feelings from the start, but then I started to really get into it all!",
        "For sure has its moments and also has James Gunn's fingerprints with the dark humor. Not sure I would rank this all that high amongst all comic book movies, nor is it near the top compared with some DC, but it's a step up from the previous entry. The performances all around were well done with Idris Elba and John Cena being the highlights but everyone else were great. **3.75/5**",
        "I was pleasantly surprised by this one, I had not watched any trailers in the run up to watching it but I was expecting it to be a bit lame but it turned out to be a good movie. I was surprised when pretty much the whole first team was killed off straight of the bat especially since some of the characters where played by well known actors, it wasn't all about Harlequin, John Cena and Idris Elba worked well together, good movie worth going to the cinema to watch it.",

Hence, without further ado, here goes \ud83d\ude09\u2757 \r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS : \r\nAs a 'doting' parent, I'm going to come clean and tell you that I had a real problem with the fact that I -{ Did }- really enjoy this -Certifiably- { Decadent } \"Bloodsoaked Adult Goof-fest\", and in no small measure either, at that. Sure it was 'dominated' mostly by -Cartoonish- violence meant only for 'Mature' viewers, ( it has an M.p.a.a certified rating of 'R' ) ; however ...the, um, how shall I say... \"Sheerly, Obscenely, Gratuitous\" levels of gore in said movie -Did- somewhat take me by surprise . . . given as it comes -directly- from the Director -best- know for his ( -relatively- ) \"More kosher\" -M.c.u- ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) . . . blockbuster fare. \r\n\r\nHIGH POINTS : \r\n1. \"Peacemaker\" : The cheeky,\u00a0 sneaky', yet unequivocally -{ \"Bold, Fresh & Fabulous\" }- takedown of the long, long, long standing -Imperialist- tendencies ; but more significantly, the -{ \"Hypocricies & Triple-standards\" }- of, \"Past United States Governments\", -Symbolically- , of course.\r\n2. Simply Put : basically -\"Everything\"- the { Stunningly \ud83d\udca3 \ud83d\udca5\u2757 } Talented Margot Robbie, ( 'Harley Quinn' ) does ; with an 'Extra-special' mention for her -protracted- \"Escape From Coronel\" fight scene. 3. Daniela Melchoir, ( 'Ratcatcher-two' ) : This peculiarly endowed 'Anti-heroine' has a seiously -Bizarre- talent... but she, along with Idris Elba's 'Bloodsport', the just bespoke Margot's 'Harley' ( -and Others- ) ...end up bringing a veritable -{ \" Ton Of -Unexpected & Genuine- Heart \" }- to 'The Suicide Squad'. \r\n\r\n**\" A Conflicted, yet -Thoroughly- Entertained, 8.50 Marks Out Of 10 From Me \" ;** if only out of 'Absolute Admiration' for the 'Funny, & Insanely-Creative' James Gunn.

They are looking to please the American government to gain some favour in return. However, some of them will surprise us with some good intentions and actions.It\u2019s an exciting movie, spectacular in its genre and filled with dark humour and great character. So let\u2019s dive into the story and some insights.\r\n\r\n**The Suicide Squad \u2013 The Story**\r\nThe American government organises a secret mission to take control of \u201cProject Starfish\u201d in the South American island of Corto Maltese. However, a recent coup overthrew the friendly American government and, the task forces created by intelligence officer Amanda Waller needs to destroy the laboratory of the secret experiment, J\u00f6tunheim. Colonel Rick Flag leads the first team that tries to enter the Corto Maltese\u2019s beach. At the same time, the second team leader is Bloodsport, an assassin who accepted the mission under the blackmail of the American authorities. Both teams will have to strive and survive to accomplish the critical goal.\r\n\r\nOur heroes, or villains, needs to save the world from \u201cStarro The Conqueror\u201d, a dangerous weapon in the hands of the not trustable Corto Maltese\u2019s government. But also prevent a tremendous international scandal that will destroy America\u2019s reputation in the world.\r\n\r\nWill our team succeed with their mission?\r\nWhat will be the price to pay?\r\nAnd what is the difference between a not trustable regime and one which conspires against the world for its interests? \r\n\r\nFull Review and Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-suicide-squad-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/the-suicide-squad-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"The Suicide Squad is everything its predecessor should have been, boasting everything a Suicide Squad film deserves. Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. \r\n\r\nWith the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. \r\n\r\nEach squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. \r\n\r\nGunn just can't seem to miss.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
        "The Suicide Squad is an uproarious extravaganza filled with grotesque nom-noms, full-on naked dick shots, and John Cena in tighty-whities and it\u2019s is the most fun you\u2019ll have with an R-rated comic book film in a theater (or at home with HBO Max) since Deadpool. It\u2019s the first comic book film to come along in a good long while that\u2019s charming because of how weird it is. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://geekshavegame.com/the-suicide-squad-review-im-a-motherf___ing-superhero/"

Keep your eye out for the tiny but absolutely -{ hilarious\u2757}- little \"Who's Dominic Toretto?\" scene ; you'll get a better feel for what I mean. But let me be ..\"Starkly\".. clear. -{ In no way }- is my review title meant to suggest to you, -even remotely- , that this is somehow 'the best cinematic offering on earth' right now, or -any- such manner of preposterous thing. The pointed -{ reason }- , as it were, for my use of the -decidedly- \" Lively \" , Benignly Parodical, & even \"mildly histrionic\" , film review -Title- that you see above, is, quite simply , 'as follows' .\r\n\r\n----- \" It's a well known fact by now that the -{ Ever }- grandiose pictures of the 'Fast And Furious' franchise seem to -forever- be looking to \" One Up Themselves \" , in terms of making their vehicular ( in particular ) action sequences -{ well and truly }- \" One-Of-A-Kind \" . In keeping with this 'practically-Sacrosanct ( \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude05 )' , time honoured tradition . . . . F9's very accomplished 'In-house' writer-Director Justin Lin has ( -Yet- ) again proven that he most certainly is the very 'living embodiment' of this rule, by taking those wild & wacky ( bespoke ) 'Gas-Guzzler Gymnastics' of his all the way , you guessed it , to -{ Outer Space }- . . . . not to mention all the -many, many- other ( almost ) as utterly, utterly, utterly '_Ludacris_' stunts performed ...seemingly as if...

Hence that 'affectionate little touch' of, well , \" Classic-hyperbole \" , in my review-Title . \" ----- \r\n\r\nAnd so, in closing, here are the things I consider to be the -{ Most }- likeable, about the picture. 1 : The ever-fresh, ever-sweet rapport that 'Dominic Toretto' ( Vin Diesel ) has with 'Letty Ortiz' ( Michelle Rodriguez ). 2 : The { Un }-deniable \" Brilliance \ud83c\udf20 \" , really , with which -Several- mind bogglingly complex, & indeed, 'super-Protracted' multiple vehicle chase & combat scenes were put together. 3 : -All- those \"giant-Magnet special effects\", ( this is -Also- teased in the trailers, which are freely available to watch on youtube ), meticulously crafted to, frankly, \".nothing less than sheer -{ Perfection }- \" . 4 : The film's -{ Delectable }- smattering of short, nonetheless utterly -Classic- \" Movie-Reincarnation sequences \" .

        "After being delayed from a summer 2020 release by the Pandemic; Universal has released the latest film in the Fast and The Furious franchise to fans eager for some adrenaline-fueled summer action.\r\n\r\n\u201cF9 The Fast Saga\u201d  has done well in the few countries it has already been released, and has raced to a nearly $300 million total which the industry hopes is a signal that people are ready to return to cinemas in numbers again and that the film will take off when it opens in the U.S. and other markets.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a flashback to the 1980s where young Dominic and his brother experience an event that changes their lives and drives a wedge between them. Moving forward to the present day, Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are living in seclusion with Dom\u2019s son.\r\n\r\nWhen the crew shows up unexpectedly with a mission from Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell); who has gone missing, the crew venture out to retrieve a missing device which in turn puts them directly in the path with nefarious individuals and a ghost from Dom\u2019s past.\r\n\r\nAs anyone who has watched any films in the series knows; the plots are often thin and a bit absurd as they serve simply as a device for the cast to assemble and chase a McGuffin to save the day. In doing so; the audience knows there will be an abundance of fists, bullets, cars, crashes, and outrageous stunts along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile reality and credibility are not words associated with the franchise, the cast eagerly plays along with the absurdity, action, and mayhem and gives fans what they want. While the middle portion dragged while the audience was given more of the setup and introduced to cast members old and new; the action sequences are the over-the-top show stoppers which have become a staple of the franchise.\r\n\r\nDirector Justin Lin knows this and his return to the franchise does not attempt to invoke any new wrinkles and gives fans what they expect. The large ensemble works well with one another and John Cena is a very interesting addition to the cast.\r\n\r\nAudiences will want to make sure to stay seated for a bonus scene that sets up the next film or spin-off very well and opens up some very interesting possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the end \u201cF9 The Fast Saga\u201d gives audiences a dose of high-octane adrenaline and a return to no-brainer over the top action when it is needed the most. Check your brain at the door, strap in, and enjoy the ride.\r\n3.5/5",
        "This delay was worth waiting for...\r\n\r\nFirst of, it was really cool how they did the flashback; looked like it was filmed in a retro camera, which made it look like it was filmed in the 1989/90s!. Clearly a nod to the first Fast & Furious film.\r\nI mean, I was confused at first by what the flashback was telling me, but halfway through the film, it started to all make sense!\r\n\r\nI give it 5 stars, for basically going overboard with the rocket launcher mounted on a car, the editing for the flashbacks, bringing back two of the characters from Tokyo Drift, combining cheesy humor with outstanding action, the redemption, the post credit scene featuring Jason Statham! And of course the surprising return of Han, and how he survived (the latter definitely had questions that needed answering).\r\nNot to mention the storyline itself was brilliantly done.",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/f9-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"F9 takes its ridiculously absurd action sequences to intolerably nonsensical levels, all while trying to tell an overlong, messy, unimaginative story surrounding one of the most generic cliches. Justin Lin ignores the little balance that the saga still possesses in previous installments, delivering insanely dumb moments throughout entire set pieces, contrary to having a somewhat acceptable action scene with the occasional suspension of disbelief in a specific situation. Daniel Casey and Lin are also unable to create a compelling narrative around Dom's lost brother, ultimately damaging years of character development for Vin Diesel's role. Bringing back Han was as unnecessary as the unconvincing explanation for his return, hurting not only this movie's pacing and extended runtime but also the emotional weight of previous films. The original cast members and the exceptional production value are enough to save this installment from being a massive disaster. If you're able to (really) shut down your brain for over two hours, this might still be an entertaining time at the theater. However, even for fans of the Fast & Furious saga, I doubt this movie will end up as one of your favorites.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D+",
        "I didn't heed everyone's advice and decided I would view this for myself.\r\n\r\nYikes!! Definitely not good.\r\n\r\nPlot holes galore, continuation errors, scene mistakes, factual errors, you name it they exist. Some things just make you scratch your head and say WTF, or smack yourself in the head because you wonder how they could be so stupid when they made this. No, I don't make movies for a living, no I am not a paid critic, I just watch movies for fun and this was not \"FUN\".\r\n\r\nIf you like action movies with bad acting then this is for you. If you have watched all the other F&F movies and think this is going to be good, then this is for you. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking a way to kill a few hours having numbed yourself then this IS for you.\r\n\r\nYou have been warned.",
        "I watched the film, but it didn't appeal to me as much as the prior films.\r\nThe change in theme and concept was one of the things that bothered me the most in this film.\r\n\r\nFrom street racing and minor crimes, the movies evolved into an idea of saving the planet. Okay, that's wonderful; you can save the world; however, how can someone reach space in his car and survive?\r\nSeriously? \r\n\r\nI don't recall this being fast and furious. The plot was similar to earlier films and revolved around Hobbs and Shaw. The story was not exceptional in any way.\r\n\r\nAnd, when it comes to action, it was unrealistic and unbelievable.\r\nThousands of cars followed Dom's crew, and thousands of guys with bullets and automatic weapons fired at them, but nothing happened to them. No one was hurt in any way. Are they immortals? \r\n\r\nI felt the absence of screenwriter Chris Morgan as the structure and storytelling were sloppier to the overall detriment of the film.",
        "Sure no one watches FF series expecting amazing plot, but surely it is now pushing the boundaries of ridiculous. I did enjoy the previous films just as silly action flicks but this one had me sighing in disbelief midway through.",
        "To some degree, with maybe the exception of Tokyo Drift and Fate of the Furious, I've enjoyed these Fast and Furious movies. Yes, they are dumb and have over-the-top action, CGI-generated, scenes yet despite that found them to be mindless entertainment with the only merit being the chemistry with the cast. However, with Fate of the Furious and the absence of Paul Walker, the series lost that aspect. Walker wasn't a great actor but he and Diesel were great together, along with the others in the ensemble where I could overlook the stupid moments.\r\n\r\nThis ninth entry, as most sequels do, takes it to the next level of absurdity but this time I really could not care less about anything going on. The action scenes were pretty lame and even though it was a joke taking the movie into space, I didn't think they'd actually do it... I could only shake my head at that sequence.\r\n\r\nThen there's the whole bringing Han back to life. They have now retconned his scene for a second time and somehow, despite this being an outlandish franchise, cheapens any character development for Deckard Shaw (his entire reason for \"killing\" Han was out of revenge for putting his brother in a coma, although IIRC initially Owen Shaw was thought to have been killing in Fast Five).\r\n\r\nThey try to add some BS depth with faith and, of course, FAMILY, that doesn't land. Hell, there's even discussion from Roman (Tyrese) about being invincible played as a joke only to come true once he and Tej go into space to stop a satellite and actually f'ing survive.\r\n\r\nThe film also is a greatest hits with the return of characters from previous entries including Helen Mirren, Lucas Black, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, Shea Whigham (had to look him up, he was in Furious 6), Sung Kang, Shad Moss (aka Bow Wow), etc. Plus Jason Statham makes an uncredited cameo.\r\n\r\nBoy, yeah the Fast franchise jumped the shark a while back but this one is on the bottom of the list. I don't know how they will right the ship with #10 (and supposedly the last) but the issue with these sequels is they have to top the previous no matter what.\r\n\r\nDumb is fine. Lazy not so much. **2.25/5**"

        "Ask anyone who has ever spent time at a Disney park what attractions they enjoy riding and chances are good that the Jungle Cruise will be amongst them. The project was a labor of love for Walt Disney and has thrilled millions of guests with the scenic cruise, animated animals, and the cringe-worthy puns and jokes from the captains who have made it an enduring legend.\r\n\r\nSince attractions ranging from \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d, \u201cThe Haunted Mansion\u201d and \u201cThe Tower of Terror\u201d have made their way to screens along with others over the years; it was not much of a shock to hear that The Jungle Cruise was next in line to make the leap to the big screen. Despite several release date changes and then a lengthy delay due to Covid; the film has finally arrived backed by a star-studded premiere at Disneyland.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Lilly Houghton (Emily Blunt) with the help of her high-maintenance brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) desire to find a mythical item and gain entry into a prestigious organization; they are hampered by the sexist views of early 1900 England and forced to steal an artifact and race to the Amazon.\r\n\r\nWith a dangerous foreigner; Prince Joachim Jesse Plemons and his goons in hot pursuit, Lilly and her brother find themselves in the company of a boat captain named Frank (Dwayne Johnson); who in dire need of money uses all sorts of methods to gain a charter and take Lilly and her brother into a dangerous area.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, all manner of humor, action, and dangers arise as everything from hostile natives, animals, rapids, and of course, The Prince stands in their way. If this was not bad enough; there is also a matter of a curse that must be factored in which presents an even bigger danger than before.\r\n\r\nIn a race against time, Frank and Lilly must learn to trust and work with one another and decipher the clues to save the day and keep the forces of evil from winning.\r\n\r\nThe film takes a bit of time to get going as while there is some action and great scenery and sets; early on it does seem to be unsure of what type of film it wants to be and what type of story it wants to tell.\r\n\r\nIs it a madcap adventure with a dash of romance? Is it an FX-laden action spoof? Perhaps it is an over-the-top action film that recalls the fabled cinematic adventures of old?\r\n\r\nIn reality, the film is a combination of all of the above. I had flashes of \u201cThe African Queen\u201d, \u201cRomancing the Stone\u201d, \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d, \u201cPirates of The Caribbean\u201d, and \u201cThe Mummy\u201d  during the film.\r\n\r\nWhile the MacGuffin element of the film may be a bit confusing for some with more questions than answers; Blunt and Johnson work very well with one another and Whitehall provides a wider element to his character making him more than the comic relief in the film.\r\n\r\nThe FX are very enjoyable and the film mixes the humor with the action well including some of the best jokes from the attraction.\r\n\r\nWhile it may at first glance be considered just a routine adventure film; the movie blends a strong and enjoyable cast with a fun adventure that recalls the thrilling cinematic tales of old but does so with a fresh and modern twist.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",
        "This movie was never short of laughter.  It incorporated the same types of jokes heard while riding the attraction of the same name.  The movie was a mix of Pirates of the Caribbean, Indian Jones, National Treasure, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It follows similar plot to each of these movies.  People want treasure > Bad people want the same treasure > They both find the treasure at the same time > The good people manage to get the treasure.  Even though it's a recycled Disney movie, the jokes throughout the movie make it worth a watch.",
        "I had a good time watching Jungle Cruise because the thrills just keep on coming. As someone who likes adventures on reel, Jungle Cruise met all my lofty expectations: mythology and legend, a smart-aleck skipper, an Englishwoman and her sweet-faced brother, and the Amazon rainforest. Give it a go even if you are not familiar with the Disney link.",
        "Things That I Liked Most In The Jungle Cruise Movie!!\r\n\r\n1) Perfect Casting Dwayne \r\n\r\nJohnson and Emily Blunt were electric together. They both bring so much fun to the movie. I love their chemistry. \r\nBesides the main hero and heroine, the character of Jack Whitehall was excellent. He played the role of Emily's brother & he rocked it with his performance. He brought so many comedic moments. \r\n\r\n2) Great Comedy And Action \r\n\r\nThe action & comedy were moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points. \r\n\r\n3) World-Building \r\n\r\nThe sets, costumes, animals, vibrant colors, darker elements of Amazon, the intro of main characters, every single thing was beautiful enough to maintain the classic atmosphere.",

Not to mention all the masterfully executed _Slapstick_ humour \ud83d\ude02 { a little taste of which is in the movie's -\"Official Trailer 1\"- ( August 2020 ) }. All in all, expect Two-hours-and-seven-minutes of Non-stop **\" Lavish, Wholesome, -FAMILY - \" entertainment .** \r\n\r\n**2. So, Does He Still Charm, Endear, & Delight ?** Short answer : **YES . . .** he can , & -_Does_- , still ( well and truly ) \"Rock\" The Boat. **HOWEVER,** I sincerely urge you not to expect any particularly 'Oscar-worthy' sort of performance from 'The Man' himself, Mr. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Meaning { things like } : you're just going to get the 'Same-Old', run-of-the-mill _American Accent_ from him yet again . . despite him playing the role of a _Spaniard_ . . living in -Brazil_. ( Although to be fair, this was almost _Certainly_ a directorial-Call by the picture's absolutely **_OUTSTANDING_ \ud83c\udf20** Director, Jaume Collet-Serra ; for reasons I -Shan't- disclose, for fear of giving away '_too much_' ). Simply -{ _Expect_ }- to see him put in a **\"Thorough & Dedicated Performance\",** with a few _impressive_ \"Surprises\" sprinkled in to the mix, for what it's worth. And inasmuchas the sister-brother duo of Emily Blunt's 'Lily Houghton' & Jack Whitehall's 'MacGregor Houghton' are concerned, ready yourself for an incredibly **'FUN'** journey with these two \"_Effusive, mega-Talented Stars_ \", and veterans of Film and Telivision, respectively.

He portrays the tyrannically _'Monstrous''_ German **\"Prince Joachim :** _your worst nightmare straight outta World War 1_ \", in Jungle Cruise. In real life, he's the partner to bubbly, adorable global **'Giga-star', Kirsten Dunst** { _ALL_ the 'Spiderman' films ( _the ones with with Tobey Maguire, that is_ ) 2002-2007 }. So here's the thing. Not much having been a big afficionado, for the most part at least, of the whole **'Breaking Bad'** thing, { arguably his first 'REALLY, REALLY' big-break ( _as 'Todd Alquist', 11 Episodes, 2012-2013_ ) }, I'd somehow managed to let his **\"WHOPPING\ud83d\udca5\" _Sixty-Three Acting Role Career_ ( _Thus_-**far, at least ) ; somehow slip under the radar, with the sole exception being his ( relatively ) \"Diminutive\" -yet \"tremendously enjoyable\"- part as the genuinely likeable 'Jimmy -Ordy- Ord' in 2012's massive blockbuster, 'Battleship'. And _Now_, to see him { almost as though } \"coming out of nowhere\", take on this _Way_ larger-than-life kind of part ; & play it with Utter, Consummate , **\" C L A S S \"** . . . . ( oh, & don't even det me -Started- about his _German Accent_\u00a0 ). . . . suffice to say that his performance was 'Gloriously, Gleefully And\u00a0 Mischievously',\u00a0 well . . . . **\" _IMMACULATE_ \" .** \r\n\r\n**Summation :** It certainly bears mentioning, just before you & I part ways ...that I actually -_went_- on the **\"_REAL-LIFE_ CRUISE\"** ( that this veritable cinematic gargantuar gets its name from ) at the \"_ANAHEIM_\"-Disneyland... with my late, & **Super-Beloved Dad \ud83d\udc99,** on his 50th Birthday.

And indeed, if not for the all the titularly referenced, **\"GROSS-OUT\"** _Mud|Slime|Bees,_ I might just have given this film my { _trademark_ **;)** } 12 or -even 13- out of 10, ( reserved **-_Exclusively_-** for films that I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY enjoy ). However, as that stuff -_DID-_ actually bother me a fair bit, **( SORRY, BUT THAT'S JUST _-ME_-\u00a0 )** . . . It's going to remain a **Solid 10 Marks Out Of 10.** Still \" not too shabby , eh \" . . . \" _Wouldn't 'Ya Reckon_ \ud83d\ude05 \ud83d\udca5\u2753\" .",

        "After a delay lasting 19 months; the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has returned to the big screen with \u201cBlack Widow\u201d. The film takes place between \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her \u201cfamily\u201d as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.\r\n\r\nSince Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\r\n\r\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha\u2019s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\r\n\r\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former \u201cFather\u201d the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\r\n\r\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlack Widow\u201d fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; \u201cBlack Widow\u201d was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.\r\n4 stars out of 5",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-widow-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex \"family\" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
        "The first half of black widow was very strong and emotional. Florence Pugh was stellar in this movie. She was brilliant in action sequences and I like the fun elements in her character. Yelena and Natasha's chemistry was too good. David Harbour also performed very well. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences were good but CGI was too weak in the 3d act. Also, I didn't like the changes in Natasha's character. She has no superpowers like other avengers. Her strong brain and mind combine to make her a lethal weapon but they showed her over powerful in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe inner wounds of Natasha were beautifully delivered in this movie. I liked the movie but because of Florence only.",

I invite you in earnest, { -Especially- if you're somewhat new to the whole \"M.C.U-thing\" }, to view one particular -Official- trailer by them, the one -still- entitled \"New Trailer\", ( YouTube, Apr.03, 2021 ), where the, 'rationale' ( -if you will- ) for B.W is explained, um, \"Super\"-well . . and is narrated by -none- other than, you guessed it, the \"Hopelessly-Vivacious and yes, genuinely-Affable . .

Looking to the 'bigger' things : Basically, the picture filled in a -{ Whole }- bunch of gaps and 'story-holes' for me { that would often -totally- have me headscratching for \"Answers\" in the unbearably -Long- spells between each successive new ( & 'ever More Madly' ) anticipated \"Massive\" New Marvel-release. And it managed to -Achieve- this by essentially showcasing a \"Wide\", ( frankly ), and previously -Unknown- array of intertwined \" Backstories \ud83d\udcda \" ...( not to mention giving us a satisfyingly -thorough- insight into the smattering of \"badly damaged relationships left in the B.W's wake\" )... that occurred -{ Well before }- & indeed, leading up to, her \"very, very, very\" high-priced and hard-won \"Formal-entry Into Shield\" { and concomitant defection from the Russian Secret Service, the 'F.S.B' ( formerly the 'K.G.B' ) }.

        "Subpar Bond that believes it has emotional stakes isn't exactly a very winning formula. Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over \"killing\" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with. She is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie",
        "Honestly, if Black Widow opened Marvel\u2019s Phase 4, I would have been even more impressed. However, after seeing the deep dives into characters that had been on the sidelines for years, this movie felt very surface level of the complexity of Natasha Romanoff. She was taken as a child to learn how to be an assassin, she had to sacrifice her morals to leave her past behind, she basically remained an assassin for a different organization that turned out to be run by similarly bad people as those she left, and she is now on the run from the government that once hailed her a hero because she didn\u2019t fall in line. Oh, and she is reconnecting with her past fake family that gave her and Yelena back to the Red Room as soon as the mission was over. The trauma this character endured would\u2019ve been better explored as a mini series, rather than a movie that\u2019s trying to simultaneously remind us of where Natasha was five years ago and also trying not to acknowledge that Natasha has no risk posed to her in this movie because we know she lives on past these events. However, very excited to see where Yelena goes in the future.",
        "It was okay",
        "It's crap, really. Nothing works in this movie.",
        "Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it\u2019s revealed who is under the mask. Everything else about Black Widow feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by and mostly feels like a diluted imitation of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It\u2019s fantastic that women are getting more opportunities in big summer blockbusters like this one, but it\u2019s also disheartening since their filmmaking skills are shackled to formulaic superfluity that obviously stands in the way of creating extraordinary cinema. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://geekshavegame.com/black-widow-review-espionage-exhaustion/"

        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/old-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Old is one of those cases of a remarkably unique, intriguing concept failing to reach its potential due to an overall disappointing execution of too many ideas. M. Night Shyamalan delivers yet another divisive film, tackling deeper themes associated with our relationship with time and how the latter impacts people in distinct ways. The trademark final act revelation not only negatively affects the main theme of the movie but also raises dozens of plot and character inconsistencies, too many to handle. The acting is surprisingly as poor as some of the awful dialogues, despite great casting concerning the kid-to-adult transitions. The main family's arc is one worth investing in, but there are too many disposable, irrelevant characters. The technically accurate, detailed cinematography might not be pleasant for every viewer, but the editing definitely lacks some finesse. Unfortunately, I can't defend Shyamalan too much on this one...\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-",
        "I liked Old not for its horror elements (at least the very little that it has) but for its themes about aging and regrets in life, something that hit home. There may be several flaws with this weird drama but the central theme of how we take life lightly when we are aging slowly really stayed with me. Recommended."

        "The artists at Disney and Pixar have returned with a new animated film \u201cLuca\u201d which will debut on Disney+ on June 18th.\r\n\r\nThe film introduces audiences to Luca (Jacob Tremblay); a young Sea Monster who lives with his family and fellow fish off the coast of a small town in Italy. Luca is warned not to go on the surface and to avoid humans at all costs by his parents.\r\n\r\nWhen a rebellious Sea Monster named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer); happens upon Luca and gets him to the surface; Luca discovers that he and Alberto appear as human boys when their skin is no longer wet.\r\n\r\nFascinated by the rebellious life Alberto leads and amazed by what he sees upon his brief land excursions; Luca looks for new ways to find time on the surface which leads to him being more and more deceptive to his parents.\r\n\r\nIn time Luca and Alberto head to the village and meet a spunky local girl named Giulia (Emma Berman); who is on a break from school and longs to win a local race in order to get back at the reigning champion and bully.\r\n\r\nLuca and Alberto see the race as a chance to win money to buy their own Vespa which they see as the key to exploring the surface world which sets a chain of events into motion as their two worlds are about to collide leading up to the race.\r\n\r\nThe film is visually appealing, but the story for me dragged and did not have the spark and heart that have made countless PIXAR films enduring classics. While the characters were fine; they did not have the appeal or charisma that I have come to expect with the PIXAR brand.\r\n\r\nThere have been reports that after \u201cSOUL\u201d was moved from a theatrical release to streaming during the Pandemic that some at PIXAR were upset with the decision to make \u201cLuca\u201d a streaming option.  My take is that it was 100% the correct decision as while it is an entertaining film; it is not one that is likely to light up the Box Office and is better suited for a streaming debut.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with \u201cLuca\u201d is that coming from a studio with such a long line of classics; it fails to reach the levels previously set and while entertaining comes up lacking.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/luca-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Luca follows the studio's formulas of success closely without taking any unique detours, but it still tells a compelling story with relatable characters that gets to the viewers' heartstrings. From the detailed animation that makes the Italian coast look realistically astonishing to Dan Romer's rich score that hits all the right notes, without forgetting the outstanding voice work, every Pixar's trademark technical attribute is present in an admittedly less complex, unsurprising narrative. Enrico Casarosa takes Jesse Andrews and Mike Jones' light screenplay through a generic structure, where the \"feeling/being different\" theme is efficiently developed but closed in an underwhelming manner. Nevertheless, predictability means nothing in a movie where fully-developed characters spend the summer creating genuine friendships with an impactful emotional weight that might induce a couple of tears in the last few powerful minutes. It's not my favorite Pixar flick, but it's definitely a good film that I wholeheartedly recommend watching.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is full of fun and child-like wonder, with a surprising edge to it as there is an usual amount of violence directly related to the main characters.\r\n\r\nThis has a very wholesome feel to it as it has the romantic aspect of searching for new frontiers and adventures, but not necessarily for romantic relationships.\r\n\r\nThe story does a good job of pacing out the events of the movie allowing for each aspect to take the focus it needs.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a movie about a triatholon, it's a better story about freedom and acceptance."

        "I will be short. You should understand how hard to make movies based on such a legendary universe (expectation is too high!), with a lot of characters that need screen time, and with limited budget, PLUS in a pandemic situation, - the director made a great job.\r\n\r\nThis is the best adaptation of such a legendary title.",
        "Mortal Kombat Gives Fans Of The Franchise The Brutal Live-Action Version They Deserve\r\nFans of the Mortal Kombat series have known that the path to bringing the violent and controversial game to live-action formats has been a mixed bag. While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
        "I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).  The previous movies were fun and didnt take themselves seriously - which was good, but they got too hammy and over the top.  The last cartoon took itself way to seriously and was disappointing and forgettable to say the least.  \r\n\r\nThis movie, however seemed to grab everything good from the previous attempts, added actors who know some martial arts, used some of the key terms and moves from the games and had a stand out performance from Josh Lawson as Kano adding the 'very dry type of  Australian' humour.  Hell, the score was even good.  \r\n \r\nGiven that this is pretty much the same as the game - 10-12 fights some spectacular fatalities and a basic plot with no character development - this was a very fun way to spend 2 hours.",
        "Fluff entertainment at its most bland. The fighting is pretty forgettable but at least they utilized the R rating for some decent gore that honors the game at least. Acting is at best so-so while the dialogue was pretty bad and it probably 10-15 minutes too long. Can't say I'll remember this but for what it is, it's fine as a time-waster. **2.75/5**",
        "Okay so let's start by saying I wasn't exactly sure what to think going into this movie I didn't know what was going to happen but wow this is one of the best action films of the decade so far yeah it started slow but really was a good full time of excitement",
        "OK LETS start off with if you have not watched the latest animations of mortal kombat this will movie will make you feel abit effy. You will need more background on the actual characters you know from previous movies and those you don't. and the True scorpion and sub zero animation also covers alot. Good fighting movie though. Shouting GET OVER HERE!!!!!!and FINISH HIM haha it makes a person feel like you part of it."

Delivering his best performance as 007, Craig finishes his memorable run in a high-stakes film with some of the best action sequences of the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the practical sets and locations, stunt work, cinematography, and editing are all no short of impressive, working together beautifully to create magnificent set pieces.\r\n\r\nDespite an overlong runtime with an exposition-heavy second act and a terribly stereotyped villain with unclear motivations, the emotionally compelling narrative sets up a powerful third act boosted by an epic score.\r\n\r\nCary Joji Fukunaga brilliantly directs a movie packed with phenomenal performances that will leave no viewer indifferent.

The third act gets extremely over-the-top concerning the action set pieces, which are only tolerable due to a special yet underdeveloped character trait that ultimately justifies the more absurd moments. Mauro Fiore's camera work and Conrad Buff IV's editing are decent enough, but the last act features too much shaky cam and excessive cuts for my taste.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, that's where things get tricky. Ian Shorr's screenplay boasts a genuinely interesting premise with exciting world-building to support it. However, the tiresome voice-over from Mark Wahlberg - who offers a good performance just as the rest of the cast - holds heavy exposition that's then repeated in dialogues across the movie, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. This narration rarely adds anything relevant to the story or impacts the viewer's opinion about the protagonist.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it's one of those films that carries tremendous storytelling potential but never reaches it. Personally, I truly find the concept intriguing, but its development doesn't leave the base of its premise. In fact, just by watching the main trailer, most of the world-building is given to the audience in those few minutes. Honestly, in better hands, this movie could have been the beginning of a new franchise with infinite - no pun intended- possibilities to make sequels, prequels, spin-offs, or even trigger the start of a TV show.\r\n\r\nAs it is, Infinite is nothing more than an inoffensively entertaining flick that could have been much, much better.\r\n\r\nRating: C",
        "Pretty good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI feel like I had a lot of problems with this movie.  The concept is good, but not very cinematic, so it feels like they tried to add action to \"Ad Astra\".  With Mark Wahlberg as the main protagonist, a lot of the movie, as I could think was \"Somwon stohl mah teddy bwear\" so that ruined the vibe a little.\r\n\r\nA large part of it is that the story takes place over centuries if not millenia, so clearly that's not part of the movie, so we miss out on caring about who these immortals are as characters.  You're sort of just told to care about them.\r\n\r\nFor at least part of the movie I identified with the villains more because their plan is actually laid out with some level of clarity and a surprising amount of reason: kill everyone and there is nowhere to resurrect.\r\n\r\nSort of a fun interpretation of \"When your enemy goes to ground, leave no ground to go to.\".\r\n\r\nUltimately this is a high end cast, with plenty of money behind the production, so it looks good, and has an interesting concept, but just sort of falls flat on the execution.  I just never really cared about the characters."

        "Amazon Prime\u2019s purchase of The Tomorrow War from Paramount was a bold move as the FX-laden film starring Chris Pratt reportedly cost around $200 million to purchase and follows prior purchases of Paramount films by the streamer.\r\n\r\nPratt stars as an ex-soldier named Dan Forester who has just been turned down for a research job he has been seeking and must remain teaching science to less than enthusiastic students.\r\n\r\nWhile watching a Soccer match with his wife, daughter, and friends, the world is stunned when a group of armed individuals appear in a flash of light and tell the televised audience that they have come from thirty years in the future and are seeking help to save humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is soon learned that an Alien threat they call the White Spikes suddenly appeared and has humanity on the verge of extinction.  The nations of the world send forces into the future to help fight the war but with a very high casualty rate; a worldwide draft is soon instituted to replenish the numbers.\r\n\r\nDan is eventually drafted and told he has 24 hours to get things in order before he is deployed for seven days at which time he will be returned. Dan contemplates running and seeks out his estranged father (J.K.

        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/the-tomorrow-war-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"The Tomorrow War is one of the biggest surprises of the year, boasting an impressively creative creature design, entertaining action sequences, and a contender for the most beautiful shot of 2021. Chris McKay demonstrates all of his undeniable talent behind the camera, delivering brilliantly directed action scenes featuring excellent camera work, a chill-inducing score, and exceptional VFX - the Whitespikes look stunningly scary. Zach Dean doesn't avoid the formulas and cliches of the genre, offering a generic story with no real surprises but still possessing remarkable character work. Chris Pratt is great as the protagonist, but Yvonne Strahovski is on a whole other level, delivering one of her best performances ever in a feature film. With an overextended runtime, the last act is mostly unnecessary and less exciting, ultimately making the ending a tad underwhelming compared to the epic conclusion of the second act. I wouldn't be surprised if it gains a cult following, though. Tremendous replay value. Highly recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nIt's usually a good sign when the worst part of a time travel movie is the time travel.\r\n\r\nI could probably make an hour long video on the time travel in this movie, especially compared to \"Looper\", but I'll forego that enough to say that it's well leveraged for the purposes of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe \"White Spikes\" are amazingly well put together, though I think projectile spikes are an odd biological evolution.\r\n\r\nThe story is far from perfect, but the cast, the acting, the situation, and especially the action are all executed wonderfully with a high production value to back it up."

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nSome people really don't appreciate Guy Ritchie's style. His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques. From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I genuinely enjoy Ritchie's risky, divisive approach on the best way to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGoing in completely blind to Wrath of Man, I honestly didn't have a good feeling. I expected a generic, hollow, forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre. I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV. Well, this movie might be 2021's best surprise to date! If Zack Snyder (Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League) is often criticized for his excessive use of slow-motion, Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his high-speed action scenes. This time, the latter leaves his well-known characteristics aside and proves that he's not a one-trick filmmaker.\r\n\r\nImpressively long, uncut takes - some reach the three-minute mark - help create a tremendously tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime. Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing, making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audience's attention. Christopher Benstead's score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film. The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous, establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent. Some of you might read the following as a critique, but the build-ups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latter.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and well-filmed, which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators. Jason Statham (The Meg, Hobbs & Shaw) delivers a one-dimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie, but it works for this protagonist. The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything, so it's only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion - even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues. Furthermore, it's Jason Statham\u2026 moviegoers go see his films for his action skills, not his acting chops. When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up, there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as him.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, Ritchie didn't let go of his favorite narrative structure. Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy. Fortunately, Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment, which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do. A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable, formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting. The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development, with the focus going completely into the protagonist's mission, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nWrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year. While it's true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success, he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside, delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful, one-take build-ups to energetic, riveting action sequences. Jason Statham's one-dimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed. Christopher Benstead's score tremendously elevates the entire movie, establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere. The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary, ending with an ironically abrupt last scene, contradicting the overall steady pacing. In the end, it's a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possible.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
        "Huge Jason Statham fan. But despite the trailer, this movie was far from his greatest. He's his usual cool self, but the story is weak and performance from Josh Hartnett is downright embarrassing, to say the least. Holt McCallany is decent, but in general the characters come off as two-dimensional. You really don't care about them. I panicked when I saw Jeffrey Donovan, because his appearance is seldom that impressive. He was okay though, far from the one to blame for this B-movie. It's not bad, but certainly not a masterpiece either.",
        "Viewers who like action films with plenty of violence for the sake of having violence will love this movie. I can\u2019t deny that the action grabs you by the throat and moves you along with it. Sometimes, however, it felt to me like instead of a storyboard they worked from a murderboard: \u201cOkay, how many do we lose in this scene?\u201d  Once again I am reminded of Hitchcock. Suspense is not a bomb going off; suspense is not knowing when or if it will explode.\r\n\r\nThey took a bit of trouble to make the plot seem more intricate than it was: having maybe three flashbacks do the work of one, for example. Some of that layering of plot could have been diverted to character building and development. Only our hero is given motivation and a back story, and there are even gaps in that.\r\n\r\nBut it should be remembered that these observations are by, and for, someone who is not a fan of action films. If you are a fan, then nothing I have written here should deter you from watching Wrath of Man.",

        "Wrath of man Has all any action movie needs. A plot of intrigue and mystery with a angry person looking for revenge. honestly did not expect the movie to be good but it came out brilliantly. A man just trying getting justice for what he felt is right. The movie keeps u glued and don't lose interest. Overall good movie.",
        "Solid revenge-thriller with the usual bad-ass performance from Jason Statham. Doesn't exactly have the flare of the usual Guy Richie film but little touches here and there. The pacing feels a tad off probably because it switches from H's (Statham) POV to that of the robbers who really didn't do much for me. Still, well worth checking out. **3.75/5**",
        "If you want an evil militant and criminal drama at the same time, then you will get everything at once and even more. Just consider that the \"Wrath of Man\" is not only about shooting and unrestrained action.\r\nIf someone from friends ask me to advise a good thriller, I would recommend the \"Wrath of Man\" along with other movies of Guy Ritchie.",
        "Definitely Guy Ritchie's best in quite a while. Also, nice to see a director take his Disney dollars and return to making something original.\r\n\r\nIs it a great film? Not really. But, it's really well crafted, the story is interestingly told, and it rekindles the vibe that made Ritchie the UK's version of Tarantino when he first emerged. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint isn't necessarily about this film specifically but more it's \"type\" by which I mean it's yet another film about a guy with a secret badass background who goes on a revenge spree. John Wick, Taken, Nobody, The Equalizer, and so many others have done the same thing. Apparently bullets don't do permanent damage to lead characters? Seriously, with the damage he takes in this film he should have spent the runtime changing a colostomy bag and being wheeled to the TV to watch cartoons while drooling down his chest. But, again, that's not unique to this film. It's kinda the standard now days. I guess when so many films seem to have the intention of being a franchise a character's mortality only becomes an issue if the actor doesn't renew their contract. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind this issue, it's a really fun film. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm just getting tired of invincible heroes in films."

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe 101 Dalmatians franchise is one of those Disney properties that is always broadcasted across all main television networks during holidays in my country, usually during Christmas. The live-action films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory, even though I never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself. Cruella might just be another live-action film from the Mickey Mouse studio, but it's far from being yet another remake, much on the contrary. Just like the vast majority of the company's villains, Cruella de Vil (portrayed by Glenn Close in the previous installments) was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBesides Cruella's greedy necessities, purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.\r\n\r\nSince the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn't a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this year until this day! I didn't expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.\r\n\r\nLet me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into \"deep analysis mode\". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it's how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she's playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell's score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn't hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it's as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.\r\n\r\nCGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don't look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that's quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more \"logic-driven\" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it's not a film without silliness.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Cruella's success partially rests on Gillespie's tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella's life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella's rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nSo, let's address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix's take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone's character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist's transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn't have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it's true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't think there's room for another film that wouldn't hurt the one we just got. So, there's just one more aspect to delve into: the cast's performances.\r\n\r\nJoel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for.\r\n\r\nEmma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn't steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she's talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.\r\n\r\nI don't recall how many minutes it really is, but I can't forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.\r\n\r\nCruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney's classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don't overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney's best live-action films in the last couple of decades.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
        "It is one of the best villain origin stories. I had so much fun watching. Both Emmas are a joy to watch, they performed their characters very well. Emma is best as **Estella and Cruella** both.\r\n\r\nThe **world-building** and character development are too good. The background story of Cruella is brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is excellent and the costume designs deserve Oscar. Such beautiful costumes I get to see in this movie. The cinematography and direction are the best.\r\n\r\nCruella's character is quite similar to Joker and Harley Quinn but still, Cruella is much different from both the anti villains.\r\n\r\nShe is dark and became burned by her career and looking for revenge as well as popularity just like the joker. While she loves unique costumes, makeup, a hairstyle like Harley Quin.\r\n\r\nShe is cynical too like Harley and self-interested but then Harley is a good-hearted person who just made bad decisions while Cruella is sociopathic and a bit cruel as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun, surprising, and engaging movie. So I just loved it.",
        "Cruella is such a boring movie HOLY SH#$... You would think with that big of a cast that the movie would Go further than the animation ever did but instead it was a snooze fest. just did not capture the real crazy essence of the animation Cruella.",
        "I advise watching this movie as an independent film that tells a separate story, which is different from \"101 Dalmatians\". I also want to say that the film is suitable and those who just want to relax in the evening, and see something funny and not loaded with a deep narrative and plot strokes.",
        "This is a fun movie to watch. I have never watched 101 Dalmatians in any form so I don\u2019t have any bias as some do comparing it to other films. The script is intelligent and witty despite having several writers involved, which often leads to a flailing disorganized mess.\r\n\r\nSome of the stunts Estella/Cruella pulls off are crazily original as she fine tunes her knack for bad behavior. I will not go on and on about it \u2014 I just plain enjoyed watching it. A small part of me wonders how this crook with a heart turns into what seems to be a more evil incarnation of her later, but since I don\u2019t know the 101 Dalmatians story, I don\u2019t need to worry about it, and neither should you.",
        "Cruella is an excellent movie. Disney tried a character\u2019s revolution and we loved it. The villain is not anymore the bad guy. Everyone has a past and everyone can change. But how? Cruella will entertain you and teach you a lot of good things, about you ego and alter ego. But also about relationships between mum and daughter, friends and good people who can change the story.

        "As pure popcorn entertainment and the culmination of the Monsterverse saga, 'Godzilla vs. Kong' delivers the goods in an unexpectedly big way. This film is essential viewing for those who might like to watch a lizard punch an ape.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-godzilla-vs-kong-hugely-entertaining",
        "Satisfying through and through. Also they seemed to learn from the past mistakes (with Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) of doing too much with the human characters, here they are thankfully just window dressing for the battle between the two titans. **3.75/5**",
        "Oh Yeah!  \r\nTHE monster movie of the year is here and just how good is it!  \r\n\r\nIs the plot predictable?  Yep - I'd guessed 80% of it 2 months ago.  \r\nIs it silly?  You bet. \r\n\r\nAre the humans essential? Nah, but we didnt come here for them.\r\nWe came to see Kong and Godzilla slug it out.  And we got that!  \r\n\r\nThe scenes with the Kaiju are well thought out and choreographed (can we say that for digital fights?).  And do they ever deck it out.  \r\nThe devastation you see on the poster gives away how much of Hong Kong gets destroyed (there will be extra land available for building now). \r\n\r\nThe movie is directed and paced well - the first half sets things up for the multiple confrontation between the Kaiju; and the second half lets loose.  \r\n\r\nNone of the actors are given much to do and most seem to sleepwalk through it, but Rebecca Hall is easily the best (she is always a delight to watch), Kyle Chandler channels Coach Taylor for a couple of scenes, Julian Dennison (from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) gets some good lines and Demian Bichir is having fun as the evil rich dude (never trust rich people...in movies or real life). \r\n\r\nThe sound design and score are both on point, but everything here subsides when the Kaiju are around.  The CGI is great - and like Peter Jackson's Kong, you actually feel for the great big monkey.  \r\n\r\nThis movie is some first class popcorn, needing to be enjoyed on the biggest screen you can find.",
        "Godzilla vs. Kong suffers from what other versus films such as Freddy vs. Jason or the Alien vs. Predator films also suffered from. These films put too much value in humans when the audience just wants to see more of the on-screen monsters they either paid hard money or chose to stream to see. That\u2019s why if Legendary chooses to keep this franchise going they should do All Monsters Attack or something involving Monster Island next where humans can be spectators at best and monsters wreak havoc for up to two straight hours.

        "The REAL Clash of the Titans!\r\n\r\nIt was spectacular! The two iconic monsters in Hollywood go head-to-head in an updated remake. Both a sequel AND a crossover!\r\n\r\nThe best part was when Godzilla and Kong fought in the city, with all them tall buildings. Talk about classic monster fight! Am I right?!\r\nThe second best part was when Kong came to Godzilla's aid and the two fought together against MechaGodzilla, right up to the end where Kong gave the final blow!\r\nAnd yes, I am aware that I am putting a lot of exclamation marks in my review, but only because I really enjoyed this movie and they're my way of expressing of how frickin' awesome this film was for me! Especially for personal reason...\r\nIt has been 4 months since the third lockdown here in the UK, 4 months of cinemas everywhere closed. And in the week that every cinemas reopened the first film I wanted to see was Godzilla vs Kong.\r\n\r\nI admit that there were a couple of bits that would've improved; like more screen time from Kyle Chandler.\r\nAnd that other guy was supposed to be Serizawa's estranged son, but that was never acknowledged, despite the casting.\r\nBut other than that, not only was Godzilla vs Kong the first film I've seen since the cinemas reopened but also the best film I have seen, so far!",
        "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/godzilla-vs-kong-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Godzilla vs. Kong is the return to form from the divisive MonsterVerse. Max Borenstein and Eric Pearson manage to write an uncomplicated screenplay without absurd plot points or extremely dumb character decisions, which is all I ever asked for in this franchise, even if it carries tons of formulas and cliches. No one expects an Oscar-worthy script, but something that can serve as a companion piece to the massive battles between the Titans. Adam Wingard struggles to balance the unnecessary, irrelevant side stories that unfortunately affect the film's pacing and tone, but ultimately he's able to set up each fighting sequence nicely. Action-wise, it's the best entry of the saga, by far. From the genuinely impressive, eyegasmic CGI work to the exciting, adrenaline-pumping monster fights that will leave you at the edge of your seat, this movie is the definition of pure blockbuster entertainment. Extraordinary production value, as expected, and a perfect Junkie XL's score make this a clear recommendation.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "So after many years of flukes and alright and great movies over a decade we officially get a face off between the 2 and it kicked ass. buildings came down people died and these 2 fought a mechanical version. it is the end to a good red vs blue kinda movie.",
        "I have to admit that I expected not to like this movie. When Hollywood decides to pitch two characters, whether it\u2019s superheroes or monsters, that are essentially good against each other it usually turns into crap. Take the absolutely abysmal Batman vs Superman for instance. Then we have Kong Skull Island which, while still being watchable, had a really lousy script.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise I quite liked this movie. I really got worried when the movie started off with some nutcase activist that Hollywood likes to glorify. Then they had to kiss up to Communist News Network as well by giving them some product placement. Don\u2019t use a real world news network in fiction movies please. Especially not a well known fake news and far left propaganda machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end it all turned out nicely. The nutcase activist was really a nutcase and really really annoying but he still turned out to be on the side of the good guys.\r\n\r\nThe story was not altogether bad and although this story of the hollow earth is really far out fantasy more than anything else, even more than the idea of Kong and Godzilla themselves, I liked it. It was quite cool actually and it allowed for some nice special effects other than just Godzilla and Kong beating each other up and wrecking a few cities in the process.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects. They are really why you watch these kind of movies. Sure a half decent story and passable acting helps but the special effects are the bulk of the enjoyment. For me the movie didn\u2019t disappoint in this area.\r\n\r\nThey were overall very good and actually quite balanced. Well balanced considering the kind of movie. You cannot have a Godzilla movie without at least a couple of city blocks getting demolished after all. Having an actual wet navy battleship showing up I do ascribe to the usual Hollywood writer stupidity of course but for the rest it was really cool. I especially liked the hollow earth scenes and the strange landscape with all the weird creatures.\r\n\r\nWarning, spoiler ahead: The thing I really liked with the movie was that the writers didn\u2019t go down the route of killing either Godzilla or Kong. Something I really feared and which would have reduced the movie to a rubbish rating as far as I am concerned. Instead they threw in Mechagodzilla which was quite cool albeit predictable at this point in the movie and one which united Godzilla and Kong. Also this weird, completely devoid of any (even fictional) science, link to Gidorah was quite a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\nOverall, watching this movie was two hours well spent as far as I am concerned."

The talented director picks up a thematically rich, mysteriously intriguing narrative written by the feature film debutant Akela Cooper, and lets himself get inspired by the giallo genre. Boasting a fascinating protagonist brilliantly interpreted by Annabelle Wallis, the unexpected yet exposition-heavy revelations of the brave third act definitely improve upon a rather generic, unexciting first half. While the impressive action sequences steal the technical spotlight, Joseph Bishara's score holds divisive creative choices that might not please every viewer. For horror fans, I couldn't recommend it more.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

        "Avatar is an overwhelming, immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for <a href=\"https://domywriting.com/\">essay writing service</a>. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action.",
        "It's cinema Jim, but not as we know it. \r\n\r\nSo here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \"The Party Crasher\" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10"

        "In what is being billed as the final Purge movie; \u201cThe Forever Purge\u201d has arrived and like elements of the prior films; gains traction from current events which have only made elements of the film more chilling seeing how the film was originally planned for July of 2020.\r\n\r\nFollowing the abolition of the Purge at the end of the \u201cPurge Election Year\u201d; the Holiday where all crime is legal for twelve hours is restored due to radical elements fueling fears of illegal immigration and the increase in crime immigrants will bring to the largely crime-free country.\r\n\r\nIt is not made clear what happened with the new President who was a staunch critic of the Purge and only that it has been restored so citizens prepare for its return by arming up, barricading themselves, or paying for armed security in a fortified locale.\r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Adela (Ana de Reguera) has come to America fleeing the violence in her country as she enters illegally and finds work. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is a wealthy Rancher who along with his family hires friends and family of Adela though having some disdain for them and what they stand for.\r\n\r\nThe Purge comes and goes with the main cast unaffected and as they prepare to resume their lives; roving bands of armed gangs have continued to Purge in violation of the law similar to those who took to the street in protest of the election and plans to eliminate the Purge years prior.\r\n\r\nThis new group is well organized and has no issues taking on law enforcement and the military forcing Dylan, Adela, and their family and friends to flee for their lives. As the terror spreads, their only safety is to try to make it to Mexico who along with Canada has agreed to a six hour window to allow people to cross to escape the violence.\r\n\r\nAs the danger mounts, the severity of the movement is known as the authorities seem powerless to control and stop what is called The Forever Purge.\r\n\r\nThe film uses a slightly different formula than the prior films which focused mainly on a group of people trying to survive the night and the terrors that come with Purge Night.  There is a greater emphasis on racism and Xenophobia this time around directed more towards foreigners than minorities and poverty-stricken individuals but the underlying message is the same.\r\n\r\nThis time around we are given a longer timeframe of terror and more social commentary as there are elements from the film which seem eerily inspired by headlines past and present which makes the film even more chilling.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is rather bare and the characters do not get much development; the movie should give fans of the series what they look forward to although it lacks the dramatic tension of the previous films.\r\n\r\nIn the end \u201cThe Forever Purge\u201d is an interesting new chapter in the series but not one of the stronger entries and serves as an effective finale to the series should this turn out to be the final film.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAfter years of outstanding effort from passionate fans, Warner Bros. finally decided to give Zack Snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms. 2017's Justice League went through massive production issues - explained in my review of said film - and despite years of extremely tiresome, toxic discourse on social media, the famous Snyder Cut got a controversy-inducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut. A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole \"it's a totally distinct movie\" or \"Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage\" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its \"predecessor\".\r\n\r\nThe most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the \"Us United\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.\r\n\r\nThere's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.\r\n\r\nA common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the \"bringing Superman back\" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.\r\n\r\nRegarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "Definitely an improvement over the Whedon version and as a DC fan, enjoyed plenty of the character moments (and the addition of MM) but the story did feel off even though the film is nearly four hours long, in addition the alternate timeline part at the end felt tacked on and unnecessary. The visual effects looked like something from a video game but I can forgive that since I'd imagine it'd cost an additional $100M to make it look cleaner and more realistic.\r\n\r\nGiven what Snyder had to work with and the fact in reality the studio should've been patient and given him and his family to mourn and re-group later, I am glad this did become a reality, shame that outside of maybe The Flash movie there won't be a follow-up with Darkseid. **3.5/5**",
        "This is DC's best so far...easily.  \r\nAlthough not flawless- there are a couple of scenes that didnt need to be included - this is the version that we needed to see.  \r\nThere is so much more time given to the characters in this, the plot is better thought out and structured, and Steppenwolf is no longer a joke.  There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  \r\nThe recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then the JL and Steppenwolf is more brutal, and Superman's 'recovery' is better paced and makes more sense. \r\nThis also follows directly on from BVS and links directly into Aquaman. \r\nAnd the closing cover of Hallelujah is glorious (it near comes close to Jeff Buckley's angelic version)\r\n\r\nIt's flaws - Timing of release - I need to watch this in a cinema.  FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  \r\nAlso, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  \r\nAnd there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. \r\n\r\nBut we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. \r\nAnd I am grateful for that...thankyou.\r\n\r\nNow, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories.",
        "I really, really REALLY wasn't expecting this - it felt like the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, if Zack Snyder directed it!\r\nNo, this was Zack Snyder's vision of Justice which we should've seen, if it wasn't for Joss Whedon hadn't pissed all over it. I mean, I understand why Snyder had to pull out the production, I really do, but Whedon could've had the decency to keep to heart on Snyder's work. Looking back, it was a total disrespect to the visionary director. This film...wow! It was truly and 100% amazed me.\r\n\r\nPlus, my best highlight was the voiceover of of Superman's dads Johnathan and Jor-El reminding him of who is he - it felt poignant.\r\n\r\nThat said, a couple of things I feel I must complain about this, just small things; 1) I noticed Mera had a change of accent. Probably an original idea, but it sounded funny especially soon after 2018 Aquaman was released. 2) Victor Stone's dad Silas sacrificed himself - not only was it upsetting but it changes everything for the future of DCEU films. I guess this means they;ll have to rewrite everything for that Cyborg movie!\r\n\r\nAt least we got the introduction of the Joker (Jared Leto reprising his role) as well as the (not so) surprising twist of the Martian Manhunter!\r\nNot to mention we finally got to see the appearance of Darkseid - it was all like a fusion of 300's Persian empire and LOTR's Sauron!\r\n\r\nIn the end, this was a true masterpiece from Zack Snyder, since Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and I am so pleased - no, grateful this was made. I thank not just the director himself for returning to this project but also the many fans who petitioned this director's cut to happen.\r\nFor once, we finally had something good out of all this chaos that was covid 19, hence why they chose the song Hallelujah for their Snyder cut trailer!\r\n\r\nThank you so much, Zack Snyder - you have always been my fav movie director.\r\nJoss Whedon, you are officially dead to me!",
        "10/10 this is absolutely fantastic, just 1 word, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse",
        "I don't understand why people are getting so horned up over this movie. It's got the exact same plot as the theatrical cut, but it's longer and more drawn out with unnecessary slow-motion and scenes that any editor worth their salt would have cut out (like Aquaman's Icelandic singers). And what we're left with?\r\n\r\nDarkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf's armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, which is not at all a compliment.\r\n\r\nThe Cyborg stuff was pretty good for the most part, although the sequence with the single mother was just as pointless as Whedon's Russian family and there was absolutely no logical reason why his father had to sacrifice himself. But Snyder is a fan of fathers sacrificing themselves when there is absolutely no logical reason for it (see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel).\r\n\r\nSo what else is there?\r\n\r\n\"Superman wears the black suit!\"\r\n\r\nOkay...and...? It's just a black version of his usual suit, there's no story reason why he wears it, and it looks like Snyder intended for him to keep on wearing it. Which is stupid and doesn't fit that character at all. And amusingly enough, I see some of the people freaking out about this who in the 90s would have lost their shit if Tim Burton's black-suited Superman movie ever got made.\r\n\r\nWe also have Wonder Woman splattering bad guy brains over walls and vaporizing people RIGHT IN FRONT OF LITTLE KIDS! And once Steppenwolf is clearly defeated, Superman heat visions off part of his head FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON OTHER THAN CRUELTY! \r\n\r\nThis is what people are all pumped up for? To see Superman and Wonder Woman go all Abu Ghraib on people?\r\n\r\nOh, and we get the Martian Manhunter. Who clearly knows everything that's happening, BUT DOESN'T LIFT A GODDAMN FINGER TO HELP OUT! Martian Manhunter, it should be added, IS ABOUT AS POWERFUL AS SUPERMAN! But does he turn up at the Batcave to say, \"You could probably use my help\"? No, he just hangs back, impersonates Martha Kent, and then only shows up to offer his help AFTER THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Gee, J'onn, maybe we could have used you back when Steppenwolf WAS FLAT-OUT MURDERING PEOPLE! This movie takes one of the greatest Justice Leaguers of all, a character who has always been a model of selflessness, and turns him into a coward who sits on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course we get the Knightmare sequence, where we get to be subjected once more to Jared Leto's absolutely godawful Joker performance, Batman drops an F-bomb because idiot fanboys with the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old think that's \"badass,\" and Snyder basically riles up his little cult so they can start harassing people about #RestoreTheSnyderverse.\r\n\r\nThis whole endeavor was nothing other than a reward for the absolute worst and most toxic elements of fandom. And now that they've gotten this victory? They're going to be ten times as awful. Because now they've had their tactics validated.",
        "Admittedly, I don\u2019t know as much about DC as I do about Marvel. However, I\u2019m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they\u2019d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.\r\n\r\nDuring the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don\u2019t understand anything, they went on with the production.\r\n\r\nHiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director\u2019s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is \u201cWas this movie worth the hype?\u201d\r\n\r\nHonestly...not really.\r\n\r\nNow I write this from the point of view of one who\u2019s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven\u2019t read and equally as many storylines that I\u2019m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I\u2019m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: \u201cA Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\u201d This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that\u2019s the only comparison that I\u2019ll make - so it\u2019s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that\u2019s why they brought him on.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn\u2019t get things that he wanted, so he\u2019d complain. I\u2019m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he\u2019s not a good person - he\u2019s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn\u2019t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I\u2019ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he\u2019d step away from the writing process. He\u2019s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio\u2019s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I\u2019m critical but it\u2019s important.\r\n\r\nMy favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I\u2019ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he\u2019s second only to MIchael Keaton.\r\nNow this is where I\u2019m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on\u2026\r\n\r\nEVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE.\r\n\r\nEzra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He\u2019s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible.\r\n\r\nI HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He\u2019s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he\u2019s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I\u2019ll give credit where it\u2019s due.\r\n\r\nRay Fisher actually didn\u2019t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I\u2019d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.\r\nJason Momoa is just awful. He\u2019s not Aquaman. I don\u2019t care that he doesn\u2019t have blond hair. He doesn\u2019t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He\u2019s a much better fit there.\r\n\r\nWe also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen.\r\n\r\nI understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There\u2019s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren\u2019t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this movie is an anomaly. It\u2019s an improvement on the first movie, but it\u2019s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn\u2019t accomplish as much as it wanted.\r\n\r\nBecause of the improvements, and only because of the improvements I can only give this a 3 out of 5.",
        "Say what you want about this movie! It's great and everything. But what do you say about this app? I think you guy should hire this one. He's a keeper.",
        "Ok lets clear stuff up before hand. It's still the same movie with extra scenes. There alot of friction from which was good and bad or bad to worse. at the end its all about personal taste. Zack Snyder version was better covering the story of each character we have not seen in the series, but he also did stretch it out for so long that the movie hinges on to long. But overall a good movie just longer."

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've always questioned myself why The Conjuring Universe possesses more spin-offs than main titles since The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are, by far, the best films of the popular horror franchise. Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.\r\n\r\nWith James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.\r\n\r\nActing-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least \"based on a true story\" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.\r\n\r\nEveryone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable \"twist\" to the whole \"demon possession\" routine that marks the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.\r\n\r\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
        "Decent enough third entry that gets a little goofy at the end but I liked it, though not quite as good as the first two. I'd say Michael Chaves did a fine job directing utilizing some of the tricks James Wan did in the previous entries (like a one-shot scene going through the house early on). But like the others, the biggest plus is with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who were again wonderful together. **3.5/5**",
        "So I watched the movie and what started off well, end up like a half way Romance movie. It had it's up and downs and then peaked and fell flat. Expected abit more for a series that is this good usually."

        "Army of the Dead injects some much needed vitality into both zombie films as a whole and Zack Snyder\u2019s career as a filmmaker. Dave Bautista is also the best he\u2019s ever been as far as his acting ability goes. Gory as hell and entertaining through and through, Army of the Dead is a must-watch for action and horror film fans alike. We really needed more scenes with Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) using that giant circular saw to tear through zombie flesh though. \r\n\r\nFull review here: http://geekshavegame.com/army-of-the-dead-review-zack-snyders-return-to-zombie-flesh-eating-form/",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nZack Snyder is far from being a consensual director. Some viewers really love his work - Zack Snyder's Justice League was only possible due to passionate, hardcore fans - while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmaker's projects. Personally, despite not belonging to his enormous fandom, I quite enjoy his work outside of the DCEU. From Dawn of the Dead to Watchmen, passing through 300, I hold these films in high regard. However, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life, and it's arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the director.\r\n\r\nUsually, when people find themselves on a rough path, going back to their roots helps them get back on track, which is precisely what Snyder does here. The \"zombie apocalypse\" genre has been around for decades, but since the start of the new century, audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone, generic, formulaic pieces of storytelling. This last statement doesn't mean a few gems can't come out of it. From probably the greatest zombie film ever, Train to Busan, to the comedy classic Zombieland, there are truly great movies within the genre. So, where does Army of the Dead stand?\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the middle, labeled as \"good fun\", which is all I expected from this Netflix film. Let me get one thing out of the way immediately: this looks, sounds, and feels like a Snyder movie. Countless over-stylized shots, long slow-motion scenes, an overwhelming amount of gore and blood, bizarre song choices, a two-hour-and-a-half runtime... for better or worst, no one can complain about studio interferences this time. Clearly, the famous director had complete creative freedom, and it shows through all of the film's positives and negatives. Fortunately, Snyder's filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre, but it also works for the simple, entertainment-driven screenplay.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an action-heavy, fun, uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesh-eating characters possess. Except for a genuinely interesting storyline - though not new - concerning a specific type of zombies, everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades, which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable. From the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie, every single cliche is present in this film. Honestly, none of them really annoy me unless they're repeated to exhaustion, which I don't believe Army of the Dead does that much.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences are all well-shot, but I did expect more from them. Most scenes are just characters randomly shooting, hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal, which shouldn't be too hard, considering the recent action flicks. Occasionally, one-on-one or one-on-many combats ensue, and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character, but then it's brought down again by tiresome shootouts. Snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions, so it's always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too much...\r\n\r\nPersonally, these logical issues don't really bother me - the ridiculous third act does push my limits, I admit. However, the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem, especially when supposedly emotional, heartfelt moments end up having zero impact. I doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies, consequently bringing tonal balance to the table. Obviously, not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations, but it doesn't hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tension.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, there's a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins, and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film. The lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats. Overall, it's an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun, but I still believe it could have been a lot better. Dave Bautista (My Spy, Avengers: Endgame) is the absolute standout, interpreting the only fully-developed character of the movie. Ella Purnell (Wildlike), Omari Hardwick (Sorry to Bother You), and Nora Arnezeder (Origin) are also quite good.\r\n\r\nFinally, a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers. While I'm all in favor of creative freedom, there must always be a compromise between both parties. Snyder didn't gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason. Army of the Dead is, like most of his movies, unnecessarily long. The \"deleted scenes\" feature on Blu-rays doesn't exist for show-off. There's no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold, and runtimes are something studios can *help* filmmakers nail perfectly. In the end, I still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story, so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewers.\r\n\r\nArmy of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre, delivering an entertaining, action-driven story that will please most spectators. With his distinct, divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained, for better or worst, the standout Dave Bautista and his team fight through the cliches, lack of character development, and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement. The lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences, but all are well-shot and packed with energy. Exceptional production design and VFX aren't enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay, especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored. Overall, it's the definition of \"good fun\", so if your weekend has a two-and-a-half-hour empty slot, Netflix has my endorsement.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
        "Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nProbably the worst part of this is a trend I'm noticing from some movies I've been seeing recently where they show you what could be a better movie, in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhile this starts with a \"patient zero\" style opening, they then skip past the movie I want to see to the last possible story from the opening event.\r\n\r\nThis movie does do a lot though, and has a lot of moving parts at any given time.\r\n\r\nBatista is amazing, and everyone sort of gets lost around him, I can't tell if that's because he's a giant or if the movie wants it that way: the cast all does a fantastic job in their roles.\r\n\r\nThe movie does a couple things that I don't typically enjoy in movies: smart zombies, obvious traitors, and secret motivations.  It's like if SHIELD was in \"I am Legend\" and Black Widow kept tripping everyone else to get a rare Pokemon card.\r\n\r\nThat said, they show a fantastic amount of detail and complexity to a society that is barely explored, adding a wonderful flavor to the story.",
        "Army of the DEAD typical zombie action movie, but its not the best that's out there. Movie starts off abit boring and then goes into hyper drive midway then slows down at the end. it was abit unbalanced but that's just my opinion.",
        "Zach Snyder is a director I have an incredible amount of respect for. He has a truly original vision, he makes films unlike anyone else, and he seems to relish being a bit of an outsider who somehow gets to make whatever he wants. Sort of like this generation's version of 90's/00's Robert Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nYet, try as I might I just can't seem to actually enjoy his films. I won't bother going into it because personally I'd prefer not enjoying a wacky Zach Snyder film then being mildly entertained by most mainstream fluff that seem crafted by algorithms. \r\n\r\nIf you like Snyder's films this one will most likely be a real joy. If you don't this one won't win you over. Either way, I hope he gets to keep making his manic fever dreams because we need more films with authentic voices."

        "Last year we had a screening for \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d scheduled and eagerly awaited the follow-up to the suspenseful and popular original film. Sadly we all know what happened soon after as a two-week lockdown grew and cinemas around the world were closed.\r\n\r\nAs cinemas re-open with growing but limited capacity; the film is set for release and will be a great indicator as to if the public is ready to return to cinemas in significant numbers or will they sit it out and opt to see the film down the line on Paramount+.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a look at the day things changed for the world as Lee (John Krasinski); does some shopping while news reports come in of an explosion in Shanghai. Enjoying the weather; he joins his family at a Little League game and talks with his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) when the game is interrupted by the appearance of a large fireball in the sky.\r\n\r\nAs they head home; the city falls under attack by deadly creatures and Lee and his family narrowly escape. The film then jumps forward immediately following the conclusion of the first film and Evelyn (Emily Blunt); attempts to lead her newborn son, daughter Regan ( Millicent Simmons), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a safer locale.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcus is injured along the way; Evelyn takes refuge with Emmett who is not happy to have to care for others after the loss of his wife and despite a secure locale in a foundry; demands the family leave the following day.\r\n\r\nWhen an unexpected radio signal appears; Regan is determined to leave and find the source as she knows the frequency of her Cochlear Implant is a weapon against the creatures and she figures if that can be broadcasted and the information revealed; then humanity has a chance to fight back and win.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a very gripping and intense story as Regan and Emmett attempt to complete the mission while Evelyn and her family endure all manner of threats as they try to survive.\r\n\r\nThe film builds upon what made the first film so great in that there are strong and relatable characters and some very tense situations. The screening we attended was so quiet you could tell that audience members were so enthralled that they were afraid to make any noise.\r\n\r\nThe film ups the action and expands upon the universe without losing any of the strong character-driven elements or relying too much upon CGI to carry the film.\r\n\r\nJohn Krasinski writes, directed, and produced the film, and while he has less screen time than he did in the original; the film is the rare sequel that holds its own and actually improves upon the original.\r\n\r\nMy only issue with the film was that the ending was rather abrupt and left me with several unanswered questions. While this would be more than fine if we were assured of a third film to resolve unanswered elements; word is that a spin-off is in development so hopefully this will resolve the issues I had or at the least co-exist with a third part of the series.\r\n\r\nFor now; \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d drives home why we need the cinematic experience as from the large screen to the Dolby Atmos sound; the film is a sensory experience that needs to be enjoyed in a communal setting with maximum sensory input.\r\n\r\nThe film sets the tension meter to the max and never disappoints and I urge you to experience this film the way it was intended.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, then you probably visited my review of 2018's A Quiet Place. Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the \"next big thing\" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn't mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.\r\n\r\nMy only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It's an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn't expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski's even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.\r\n\r\nI find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski's flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I'll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they're dead. There's a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole \"sound-hunting beasts\" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it's like we're witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.\r\n\r\nPeople can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.\r\n\r\nAlmost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it's far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn't expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy's character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it's worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers' attention on the screen at all times.\r\n\r\nThroughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original's brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami's score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.\r\n\r\nA Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I've seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that's becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it's a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn't exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater. After all, both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously...\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "Not gonna say more but a worthy sequel and gives same or some might say more goosebumps than prequel but amazing work by jhon krasinski and new cinematography director etc .overall good cinematography, visuals etc was interesting.  I enjoyed it and would love a sequel. Personal rating 8 .thank you.",
        "It\u2019s not bad but really when you take a look at it from the no hype perspective it\u2019s basically a few action scenes and not much else.\r\nIt\u2019s short changing the audience in arc replacing it with an average plot.\r\nIt\u2019s not terrible and everyone is great in it. It\u2019s just the actual story is very vacuous and that disappoints.",
        "Good, not great, follow up. Some good suspense-filled scenes and solid emotive performances since there's not a whole lot of dialogue. The first one was better as a whole but this is a worthwhile sequel, simplistic which is a plus, no unnecessary drama on the human side. Don't know if I'll revisit it anytime soon but as a one-off viewing, it works well enough. **3.5/5**",
        "A Quiet Place Part II ditches the tension and the stealth the first film was known for and introduces more monsters, more action, more characters, and more of a world that\u2019s barely hanging on by a thread.\r\n\r\nLee\u2019s oldest kids become the key players here, with Emily Blunt\u2019s Evelyn Abbott taking a backseat, while Murphy proves why he\u2019s one of the most underrated actors working today.\r\n\r\nOverall, A Quiet Place Part II is an exceptionally entertaining sequel with quality performances and a primary focus on monster mayhem which, as horror and suspense fans, we should all get behind.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/06/06/a-quiet-place-part-ii-review-long-time-no-hear/"

        "In a magical land known as Kumandra; Humans and Dragons co-exist in harmony. When a threat in the form of creatures known as Druun arrive and threaten to destroy everything; the Dragons combine their power to defeat them but in doing so all but one of the Dragons remains.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney animated film \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d; audiences are introduced to the narrative of the story by Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), who tells that the world has become fractured and she is to blame. A sacred relic that the Dragons used to Defeat the Druun has given her kingdom prosperity but the surrounding kingdoms all named after various parts of a Dragon are envious of their position.\r\n\r\nWhen Raya\u2019s father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim); attempts to unite the other kingdoms, a tragic betrayal results in the relic becoming fractured with each kingdom taking a fragment. As if this situation was not bad enough; the fracturing of the relic ushers in the return of the Druun and they quickly resume turning everything not protected by a barrier of water to stone.\r\n\r\nThe story then jumps years into the future where Raya and her faithful companion Tuk Tuk (Alan TudyK) are searching the rivers of the kingdoms in an effort to find the location where the last Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) is rumored to have been sleeping for 500 years.\r\n\r\nRaya is eventually able to locate Sisu who is a very playful and animated creature and the two set off to save the day by obtaining the missing fragments through any means necessary. Naturally, their journey will be filled with dangers, adventure, and humor, as the various kingdoms have their own unique visual style and characters; some of whom join with Raya on her quest to provide much-needed support, perspective, and at times; humor.\r\n\r\nThe movie is visually amazing as the artists clearly were inspired to create a world that combines elements of many Asian cultures yet has its own unique traits. I marveled at the details of the water and ripples and how the railings on a boat showed uneven discoloration and wear in just a casual scene where the characters talked. It is this attention to detail that really adds to the magic of the film as well as the immersion into fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast was great and there are some characters I do not wish to spoil who practically steals every scene in which they are in.  My wife and I were captivated from the very start as Disney has created a film that embodies much of their classic themes and yet expands upon them to create a film the entire family will enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe movie will be released in cinemas and via a paid option for Disney+ subscribers. We attended a press screening at a cinema; our first in almost a year and found the setup to be very safe and it was amazing to see such visual splendor on a big screen.\r\n\r\nDisney has once again created a new classic and has given audiences the magic that they are known for at a time when it is most needed.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5.",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDisney purchased Pixar way back in 2006, and many incredible animated films have been released under both banners. Therefore, it\u2019s quite understandable that many people don\u2019t recognize the difference between Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar itself. The latter studio released two movies just last year (Onward, Soul), while the former\u2019s latest original film dates back to 2016\u2019s Moana. So, there was a lot of anticipation for a new animated movie from the studio that gave us classics such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and more recently, the Frozen saga. With Don Hall (Big Hero 6) and Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada (Blindspotting) at the helm, and Adele Lim (Crazy Rich Asians) and Qui Nguyen (feature-film debut) tackling the screenplay, did they succeed in delivering a good film?\r\n\r\nWell, if I must answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, I\u2019ll go with the first one. Let\u2019s start with the positives. The one thing everyone expects from a Disney animated movie is beautiful animation, and Raya and the Last Dragon features tons of gorgeous, creative, jaw-dropping sceneries. The different lands that the story takes the viewers through look impressively realistic, some of them clearly drawing inspiration from real Asian places and culture. The character drawings also look excellent, even though they\u2019re not too far from what we\u2019ve seen from 3D animation in the last few years. \r\n\r\nTechnically though, my standout goes to James Newton Howard\u2019s addictive, chill-inducing score. From the emotional tracks to the riveting tones that elevate every action sequence, it\u2019s a score that I\u2019ll struggle to get out of my head for the next couple of weeks, especially its main theme. In fact, I\u2019m actually listening to it while writing this review, and I\u2019m feeling full of energy. The sound effects for the Druun monsters are pretty eerie, it\u2019s hard not to feel the weight of their threatening presence, but the inspirational, tear-inducing soundtracks leave me floored. The action scenes are wonderfully shot and animated, bringing high levels of entertainment and excitement to a partially adventure-driven narrative. Raya\u2019s sword fighting is indisputably the most captivating type of battle seen throughout the entire runtime.\r\n\r\nStory-wise is where things get a little disappointing, to be completely honest. While the visuals share outstanding imagination and creativity, Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen\u2019s formulaic screenplay is much more straightforward and unsurprising than expected. I knew Raya and the Last Dragon wasn\u2019t going to deliver a groundbreaking narrative, but a videogame-style script is far from being a good alternative. The third act tries to challenge its story\u2019s predictability with one little unexpected moment that I undoubtedly love, but besides not changing the outcome predicted in the first ten minutes of the film, it severely damages a secondary character.\r\n\r\nRegarding this last issue, I can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s my main problem with the movie, but I would have to go into spoiler territory to fully explain it. Therefore, I\u2019ll only address the character\u2019s inconsistency, which unfortunately affects the film\u2019s primary message. The main themes revolve around trust and how if we treat other people kindly, they\u2019ll treat us in the same way. A lovely note that parents will surely want to transmit to their kids, without the shadow of a doubt. However, the character in question spends the movie not knowing where to stand, constantly betraying everyone, and even blaming others for something that same character triggered in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite having a significantly negative impact on my enjoyment of the film, the ending does work quite well and compensates for my problem with the said character. Kelly Marie Tran lends her voice to Raya, a protagonist easy to root for due to her clear motivations and important mission, while Awkwafina is very funny as Sisu, a goofy dragon with more depth than what the viewers might expect from the first impression. Everyone in the cast delivers extraordinary voice work, and every character has some sort of captivating trait that makes the audience support them, except for you know who. Having in mind that kids are indeed the target audience, I\u2019m positive all will feel delighted with this movie.\r\n\r\nBoasting a predominantly Asian American cast, all delivering exceptional voice work, Raya and the Last Dragon follows a partially disappointing, formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation, a chill-inducing score, and quite a nice ending. Walt Disney Animation Studios returns with an original story that lacks surprising elements, lending all the creativity and imagination to its entertaining, fast-paced adventure packed with undeniably impactful visuals and incredibly riveting action sequences. Despite a significant problem with an inconsistent character that profoundly affects my enjoyment of the film, all other characters are extremely likable, goofy, and well-written. A delightful message about trust and treating others kindly is ultimately well-transmitted to the viewers, which I hope parents will show their kids. Final remark: James Newton Howard\u2019s score will not leave your minds for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nRating: B",
        "'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a solid step back in the right direction for Walt Disney Animation Studios. Over the past 20 years, they've struggled to find their confidence and voice as a studio, certainly due to complicated changes of leadership and the rise of genuine artistic and financial competitors, but 'Raya' is the kind of film in which they do their best work - an entertaining and exciting experience built on a strong protagonist with a clear motivation and a powerful internal conflict. The legacy of Disney animation has been to speak to the deep emotional truths of the human experience in a way that is accessible to anyone, and with its themes of self-belief, moving through grief and trauma, and finding the trust in others and ourselves, 'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a worthy part of that legacy.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-raya-and-the-last-dragon-a-solid-return-to-form-for-walt-disney-animation-studios",
        "It\u2019s terrific to see the animated movies continuing to evolve, and \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d is the latest film that takes the traditional idea of a Disney heroine and makes a huge leap into a welcome new direction. This magical fantasy / adventure tale features inspired characters, beautiful animation, and a culturally accurate representation of Asian mythology. It\u2019s a terrific movie on all levels.\r\n\r\nLong ago in the make-believe world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. There was a complete balance to the world until an evil force known as the Druun began to threaten the land. This sinister tribe of shadow monsters rose to power by feeding off the discord of humans, and the dragons decided to sacrifice themselves to save all of humanity. New unrest nearly 500 years later has resulted in the five divided lands of the kingdom refusing to co-exist in peace, giving rise to the Druun once again. Determined to preserve the world she loves, lone warrior Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) decides to track down the last living dragon and use its magic to save Kumandra.\r\n\r\nRaya is a trailblazing heroine, and she\u2019s one that\u2019s easy to admire and love. Her determination never falters as she learns the value of teamwork and trust along her journey. The film\u2019s main characters are all female, from the last dragon Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) to Raya\u2019s adversary Namaari (voiced by Gemma Chan). There\u2019s a magical relationship between Sisu and Raya, two unlikely friends that discover in each other that exactly little spark that each of their lives were missing. Even better, Raya collects a group of misfits along her journey, reinforcing the idea that heroes can come from the most unlikely places.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s group of directors (Don Hall, Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada, Paul Briggs, and John Ripa) has created original characters that are unlike others you\u2019ve seen before, and the beautiful animation brings them to life. Sisu is a gorgeous pastel-hued dragon with a personality to match (Awkwafina is the MVP in the cast). Raya is a new kind of Disney \u201cprincess,\u201d one who knows how to take charge and can kick butt. There\u2019s so much for everyone to love here, even if some of the goofier gags (like a thieving baby who is far more irritating than cute) may take viewers out of the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is exciting and the elements of mythical adventure are spirited, making \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d one of the more interesting films to come out of Disney in a while. It\u2019s an animated feature with a positive, sincere message, lively action scenes, and a sweet tale of friendship that can be enjoyed by the entire family.",
        "Disney, like many studios, have been under a lot of pressure to produce not only a large quantity of content but it also needs a higher level of quality. There was a clear need for something new under the Disney brand that wasn\u2019t just a remake from something in the 90s and I believe Raya was a ray of sunshine to the studio. The ability to maintain the same family friendly message while still allowing animation to touch the hearts of any viewer was such an amazing feat. In order to avoid any spoilers I\u2019ll just say the journey of Raya is not only inspirational but empowering. This is certainly a win for the studio and for any viewer that gives it a chance.",
        "Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of noise about it being a rip off of this, or a rip off of that, long short that it was a non-original cash-grab.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't see what people were talking about, other than it was an Asian-ish themed animation, and those people are just unfamiliar with Eastern anime, poor things.\r\n\r\nThis feels like an untold, if not unique, world, mythology, and great characters.\r\n\r\nMy big problem with this movie is that it is fueled by stupid.  I honestly expected them to fight over the magic thing, but the incompetence of stealing a thing that keeps the world from ending, let alone breaking it into pieces is a bit much.  It actually pushes it over into a horror movie territory, and it shows at one point.\r\n\r\nThere was also the bit where they show us a movie they skipped before this one, but it may not have been the best to start a franchise.\r\n\r\nThis movie feels like an old timey fable, it gets dark, and there is a lesson to be learned.\r\n\r\nI found it full of fun, adventure and action, not to mention top quality animation.  It is well worth the watch.",
        "Me and the kids watched this movie, one of the latest works of Disney, the other evening. I am pleased to be able to write that we found it quite good actually.\r\n\r\nIt is always with some worry that I approach anything that comes from Disney these days given how their woke brigade have screwed things over lately. This movie however, seems to be more or less back to old and working recipes and free from (too much) woke nonsense. Maybe Disney execs have finally realized that letting the woke brigade, SJW\u2019s and cancel culture have any say whatsoever in the creative processes hurts the bottom line.\r\n\r\nIt is a good adventure story surrounded by lots of colorful characters, great scenery and lovely animated creatures. Just how a animated Disney movie should be. Some, probably self proclaimed, culture elite called it a \u201cmediocre and repetitive story\u201d. That is just such a load of bullshit but unfortunately the stupid algorithms on IMDb\u2019s website calls it a \u201ctop review\u201d and puts it on the front page of the movie (which is why I noticed it). Given that the movie currently hold a 7.4 rating on IMDb, 81% on TMDb and even the usually useless Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating well above 90% I\u2019d say this bloke is a minority.\r\n\r\nRaya herself was quite likable but her main adversary was rather bland in my opinion. However, the characters surrounding Raya was making up for this. I quite liked Boun, I definitely liked Tong and I just loved the baby and the three small rascals causing mischief everywhere they went.\r\n\r\nThe dragons where okay, Sisu was rather fun but they were all more like cuddly pets than real dragons with any real powers except for some parlor tricks. I did like the ending with all the Dragons being back though.\r\n\r\nIn good Disney tradition there were plenty of side characters and environmental gadgets etc\u2026 that threw in some additional laughs here and there.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above, this was pretty much what would expect from Disney, the good Disney that we used to know that made fun movies for all ages.",
        "**Introduction by SpotaMovie.com**\r\nDisney delivers another movie f**ull of adventure, colours and essential messages.

        "Now you might assume that I'm probably not the kind of person predisposed to like this film. Daniel doesn't have fun. He writes pages waxing lyrical on a film like 'Roma' that starts with a five-minute sequence of someone cleaning up dog poo, or 'A Hidden Life' that's 60% glorious shots of landscapes. But hey! I can have fun! I loved 'The Meg'! I lost my mind in the first Transformers film! When The Rock rode up a tsunami, avoiding an oil tanker that then took out the Golden Gate Bridge in 'San Andreas', I was on my feet in the cinema cheering! This film though? This isn't fun. It's too loud, too hard to follow, too bonkers to be appealing, and not anywhere near bonkers enough to be charming or good for a laugh. It's a film that basically yells at you for an hour and a half in the most aggressive, hyper-masculine way, and leaves you feeling like you've been stuck in a corner at a party for three hours having some guy tell you all about the screenplay he's going to write that will finally, finally be a good video game adaptation and never taking the hint you want a drink or a pee or a change in conversation or to run screaming from the room. I went into Paul W. S. Anderson's latest film (the guy who made 'Mortal Combat' and 'Death Race', not 'Boogie Nights' and 'Punch-Drunk Love') totally prepared to have a blast, but it gave me no time, space or inclination to do so. And then this stupid film that doesn't know whether it wants to be a bad 'Godzilla' or a shitty reimagining of 'The Dark Tower' has the audacity to set itself up for a sequel! (But hey, we're in the End Times, so it only makes sense that we would get a sequel to this trash instead of another season of 'Mindhunter'). I'm sure some people are going to get a kick out of this saga about Artemis (Hunter, of Monsters, titular) fighting big asshole spiders and being the saviour white woman to a far more impressive person of colour and crying over some ring (it was for \u201cforever\u201c, remember). For me? The whole thing is too loud and aggressive and dull to be the best kind of dumb fun.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-monster-hunter-a-meandering-mundane-monstrosity",
        "It appears that this movie is either quite hated or quite liked. I guess it is not that surprising though given that it is based on a video game with a very strong following so if the movie is deviating from canon, and I understand that it does, it will not matter how good or bad a movie is.\r\n\r\nWell, I have never played the game so I am not burdened with Monster Hunter canon so I have to say that I very much liked this movie. It does not really hurt that I quite like Milla Jovovich as well of course. Ron Perlman is also a favourite of mine and I really wish that he would have been in more of the movie. As it was he was only present briefly at the beginning and then a little bit at the end.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a fantasy, action movie of my liking. Clash of cultures, huge monsters and lots and lots of shooting, slicing, kicking and stabbing action. The story is rather simple but not really bad at all. The ships navigating the sand was a bit weird and those huge weapons they were dragging around a bit silly but then those are part of the canon.\r\n\r\nAt first I got a bit annoyed by Artemis and Hunter starting to fight each other and thought, oh no, not another one of those silly, illogical stories again, but that sorted itself out rather quickly. And the bait jokes were rather funny actually.\r\n\r\nThe CGI and the monsters were great, as far as I am concerned. When I first saw the diablos I thought that they had kind of copied the sandworms from Dune but when they, or it rather since we only got to see one actually emerge, it was quite different.\r\n\r\nThe part where Artemis is thrown back to Earth and followed by the big fire breathing beastie is probably not liked at all by the fans of the video games since it is probably not very canon but I definitely liked it. I whish they would have done a bit more surprise, what the f\u2026 and mayhem scenes there actually.\r\n\r\nThe ending didn\u2019t really leave that much of a conclusion but, unlike what some people seems to feel, I didn\u2019t think it was a bad ending. It certainly prepared the field for a sequel and I for one really hope one will come.",
        "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'm not a real fan of the video game, so I think I can safely say that you don't need to know anything from the game other than it has \"big monsters\".\r\n\r\nThe only thing I really see from the video game world is that the characters sort of \"level up\" as the movie progresses.  I guess it sort of does world building in the same way by having \"levels\" or areas, but that's much more subtle.\r\n\r\nThe movie uses isolation in several different ways and has some clever uses of limited resources to solve problems, but it is quite a bit of just fighting big monsters.\r\n\r\nI can't say that you'll enjoy this if you're into Kaiju movies, even though it has quite a bit of creature feature aspects to it.\r\n\r\nWorth the watch, but not exactly the most substantial story."

        "Liam Neeson is back in \u201cThe Marksman\u201d and despite some flaws; the film provides what his fans want and is an engaging and topical film.\r\n\r\nNeeson plays Jim; a widower who spends his time on a tiny and struggling ranch in Arizona near the border. Jim is facing foreclosure from the bank after dealing with devastating medical bills for his late wife and feels that as a former Marine he has been given a bad deal by the system.\r\n\r\nJim often drives along the border fence and radios in suspected crossings but is willing to provide aid to those who finds in distress.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim encounters a young woman and her son Miguel (Jacob Perez); he is drawn into conflict when they are pursued by some dangerous people which forces Jim to shoot when weapons are drawn killing one of the group in the process as well as the boy\u2019s mother.\r\n\r\nJim turns the boy over to the Border Patrol where his daughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick), is in charge of the local office and is concerned when he learns the boy is to be sent back to family. Seeing the individuals he had previously had a gunfight with waiting for Miguel to cross; Jim decides to honor the dying wish of Miguel\u2019s mother to take him to family in Chicago; even when that means abducting Miguel from custody.\r\n\r\nThe trip not only puts Jim at odds with his daughter but as well as Miguel who wants to return home and causes the dangerous individuals to cross into the U.S. to ruthlessly track Jim and Miguel to exact their revenge.\r\n\r\nThe film moves at a steady and deliberate pace until the finale gives fans a taste of the action that they would come to expect. It does take some patience as I saw numerous opportunities for a person of Jim\u2019s skill to attempt to set an ambush, trap, or counter the dangers facing them but the final resolutions are enjoyable and satisfying.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does not have the action and intensity of some of Neeson\u2019s recent works; it does provide enough entertainment to make it worth a watch and does contain content based on some very volatile and controversial topics which would spur intense debate.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",
        "Liam Neeson has the magic touch that gives a boost to almost any movie he\u2019s cast in, be it a love story or an action thriller. He makes the most mundane films palatable, so it shouldn\u2019t be a shocker that Neeson is the best thing about \u201cThe Marksman,\u201d a formulaic (but still entertaining) movie from director Robert Lorenz.\r\n\r\nNeeson plays Jim Hanson, an ex-Marine turned Arizona rancher who\u2019s lost his wife to cancer and is about to lose his home to foreclosure. The man lives a life of solitude on an isolated stretch of land that touches the Mexican border. While out tending to his cattle one afternoon with his beloved dog Jackson, Jim sees a young mother named Rosa (Teresa Ruiz) and her son Miguel (Jacob Perez) slip through the border fence and take off running. He stops to help the pair after they plead for protection from the assassins that are following them. Tempers flare and the encounter ends in a shootout, killing Rosa. Her dying wish is for Jim to deliver Miguel safely to extended family in Chicago.\r\n\r\nA predictable road trip follows, with the bad guys hot on their trail. The body count piles up as the deadly cartel doesn\u2019t hesitate to kill anyone and everyone who gets in their way. As they try to outrun the danger, the man and boy form an unlikely friendship and manage to stay one step ahead of the killers who remain in pursuit. Eventually their luck runs out, and Jim must do whatever it takes to fight for Miguel\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nNeeson spends most of the movie growling at Perez, who doesn\u2019t have much to do himself. The two have a nice chemistry, but Neeson\u2019s grumpy old man shtick seems more fitting for someone like Clint Eastwood. Neeson does eventually get to open up a can of whoop ass on the baddies, but this film is a slight departure from his normal action star routine.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows standard genre conventions, has plenty of gun violence, and will meet the the expectations of its target audience. Not only is the movie competently directed, but there\u2019s more than enough to enjoy here \u2014 especially if you\u2019re looking for mindless entertainment with a hint of a social message. The sentiment is progressive for an action movie, and the illegal immigration angle doesn\u2019t feel forced. It actually works as a means of bringing the characters together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Marksman\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a notable player in the action genre, but it\u2019s a good film for those who want a well-made, solid action movie with few surprises.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore"

        "I rewatched the 1992's Candyman in preparation for Nia DaCosta's (Little Woods) direct sequel, so I could get the most out of it without having to force my memory to kick in. Despite being addicted to Philip Glass' score of the original film, Bernard Rose's take on Clive Barker's short story isn't exactly one of my favorite classics, even though I appreciate it quite a bit. Expectations-wise, I didn't know the director beforehand, but I was curious to see what DaCosta could bring to the famous tale.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not the right person to tackle the heavy themes depicted in the filmmaker's sophomore flick. From an evident, strong opinion about gentrification to the biased white critical lenses, the director has a clear vision and firm messages concerning cultural injustice. As a white European young man, I'm not going to pretend to have experience or even enough knowledge to approach these necessary, sensitive debates, so I'll let other critics, namely Black authors, spread their voices.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have mixed feelings about this sequel. Despite being beautifully shot (John Guleserian), edited (Catrin Hedstr\u00f6m), and scored (Robert A. A. Lowe), the thematically driven screenplay often feels forced and occasionally preachy. Characters are thinly developed through an uncommonly too short runtime. The never-ending silhouette recaps of the previous movie are unnecessary, and weirdly enough, a major revelation of this sequel is partially ruined by simply (re)watching the original film. The extreme gore is still present, though slightly toned down, at least from my perspective.\r\n\r\nTechnically and visually, it's truly one of the most interesting movies of the year. Sadly, it isn't able to transmit the same quality to the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C"

While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

        "Massive, epic movie. I'm so happy that Marvel is stepping up their game with their villains. For too long, MCU villains have been too bland and generic. But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!",
        "Best Movie Ever...",
        "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

All the pieces were patiently put in place. The payoff? Never did my inner 8 year old think he would ever be watching a movie with Iron Man and Spider-Man sharing the same screen together, but here we are. Avengers: Infinity War is a very fine piece of 'turn your brain off' storytelling, except it actually goes the extra mile to have some intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe all know the film isn't the Endgame, but we're primed and ready for Part 2. Shut up and take my \ud83d\udcb0 Marvel!",

        "It is unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema. This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!",
        "The character development for Thanos was so good that it made me think that maybe he was right. He was the villain that surpassed all the other villains from the past Marvel movies. Trust me, this is the movie that might have changed the MCU.",

        "Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers."

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe superhero genre has been growing exponentially during the last decade, so it's bizarre to go through an entire year with only Birds of Prey and The New Mutants instead of literally dozens of films from both Marvel and DC. Thankfully, Warner Bros. decided to release Wonder Woman 1984 before the year's end, but not without a catch. Most people will only have the possibility of watching one of the few blockbusters of 2020 through HBO Max, a streaming service only available in a couple of countries, while some incredibly lucky moviegoers might have the chance of seeing this visually epic film in theaters, depending on the country's pandemic rules.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I'm one of those lucky people who got the opportunity to end 2020 on a positively immersive note by watching Patty Jenkins' latest flick in an almost empty IMAX theater (paradise). If you've been following me for some time, you know I'm a firm believer and defender of the so-called \"theater experience\", and I can't hide the fact that I felt extremely emotional going into one of the best, biggest theaters in Portugal to witness one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020. Until 2017, DCEU struggled to deliver a massively loved installment, and Wonder Woman came to the rescue. It was one of my favorite films of the respective year, so I was obviously excited for its sequel, even more having in mind the circumstances we're all living in.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this sequel stands close to its predecessor. With a lengthy runtime known for being associated with absolutely epic movies, I was confident that WW84 could deliver a solid film with great villains for a change. Well, Kristen Wigg and Pedro Pascal are definitely two of the indisputable standouts. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham made the right decision in dedicating a significant portion of the screenplay to Barbara Minerva and Max Lord. Their arcs are far from being groundbreaking, but they're a thousand times more effective than the \"CG punch bag\" narrative.\r\n\r\nBarbara follows the \"lonely, insignificant, no one cares about me\" archetype, and Wiig does a surprisingly remarkable job in portraying this character, but the script is what really makes her shine. At first, her comedic mannerisms left me a bit dubious about the eventual character's likeness. However, as time flies by, it's almost inevitable to feel sorry for Barbara, making her future motivations understandable and perfectly natural. On the other hand, Max Lord is apparently exploding with conviction, but his life is not as amazing as everyone might think. This time, it's Pedro Pascal who ends up elevating the character, delivering a brilliant performance with just the right amount of over-the-top expressions.\r\n\r\nEven though these two are magnificent, Gal Gadot continues to prove that she's one of the best casting choices of the millennium, interpreting Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. I seriously cannot imagine another actress wearing that costume, throwing that Lasso of Truth, incorporating the character's essence as seamless as Gadot. In this movie, she was able to perform highly emotional scenes, nailing every single one. Her chemistry with Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) is palpable on the other side of the world, and their interactions go through every zone of the emotion spectrum. Regarding Steve, I'm not going to spoil how he comes back or anything concerning his arc, but I can safely write that his presence in the film is both necessary and logical.\r\n\r\nThe biggest compliment I'll offer this sequel concerns its screenplay and direction. Finally, I can confidently write that the DCEU is capable of producing a well-structured, well-developed story with well-written characters. It doesn't have as much action as the original, but I still didn't feel the 151 minutes. WW84 flows incredibly well due to Jenkins' ability to fill up the runtime (almost) only with important scenes. There's a slight \"over-persistence\" in the attempt at sending a certain message (I'll get there), but story-wise, I sincerely wouldn't take a second out. Even the comic relief moments, particularly with Pine (who plays some sort of parallelism with the first movie's Diana), are welcome and timely.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes might be low on quantity, but the few that the audience gets are long, complex, and technically challenging to pull off. The opening sequence alone almost made me tear up due to its epicness. Hans Zimmer's powerful score, Richard Pearson's clean editing, and Matthew Jensen's camera work all work together to present a lengthy, grand, wide view of an Olympics-style obstacle course with young Diana. Throughout the entire film, the action is colorful, vibrant, fun, and entertaining\u2026 except for the (supposedly) climactic clash.\r\n\r\nWell, to be fair, there are two climaxes during the last thirty minutes since WW84 owns two antagonists to play with. One of them is closed in perfect fashion, with the emotional stakes at their highest. Great job there, no complaints whatsoever. However, the main fight sequence inexplicably contrasts with the rest of the movie's action. The vibrant colors disappear and are replaced by a dull grey, which makes one of the characters involved (who shares the same color tone) hard to notice, transforming an epic final battle into an underwhelming, barely comprehensible collection of awkward cuts, punches, and screams. Gadot's golden suit is way less exciting (and poorly lit) than her original costume, and Barbara's arc ends without real closure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Jenkins insists too much on passing to the audience that greed brings horrible consequences. \"Be careful what you wish for\", \"money and power can't buy happiness\", \"be thankful for what you have\", and messages along these lines are repeated continuously (implicitly and explicitly). I admit that it might be a nitpick of mine and that not many people will feel like I did, but I couldn't help but feel that some moments sounded and/or seemed a bit preachy and way too repetitive. Also, it's a bit weird how the official premise mentions Wiig as Cheetah, but this word is not mentioned once in the entire film\u2026 Nevertheless, don't be mistaken: I'm thrilled that WW84 is the last flick I watch at a theater this year!\r\n\r\nAll in all, Wonder Woman 1984 proves that DC continues on the track of success by delivering a well-structured, well-developed DCEU installment without an absurd amount of overwhelming CGI and/or forgettable villains. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham's impressively layered screenplay makes the lengthy runtime feel adequate not only by offering epic, exciting, technically superb action set pieces, but also due to the remarkably well-written heroes and antagonists. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are outstanding together, but Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal steal the show as the newcomers. With two wonderful \"villains\", WW84 boasts a solid, elaborate narrative that I was lucky to witness on the big screen. Unfortunately, the climactic battle is disappointingly underwhelming and colorless, Barbara's arc ends abruptly without true closure, and Jenkins insists too much on the thematic message of the story. These issues may affect more viewers or not, but one thing's for sure: it's one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year, worthy of being seen on a massive theater.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
        "Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince in \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d which has seen its release date shift a few times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The film has started to open overseas and will arrive in the U.S. on Christmas day with a limited debut on HBO Max as well.\r\n\r\nThe story sees Diana now living in Washington D.C. in 1984. Diana is popular but has refused male companionship as she still longs for her late love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).\r\n\r\nDiana works in the Smithsonian Institute in antiquities and keeps her secret identity under wraps even when a daring mall heist forces her to leap into action.\r\n\r\nA shy and passive employee named Barbara (Kirsten Wiig); who is afraid of her own shadow and largely ignored by her peers is befriended by Diana and they discover one item from the heist is inscribed with the ability to grant a wish. Unknowingly Diana wishes for Steve to return and Barbara wishes to be more like Diana which sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nA shady business man named Maxwell Lord (Perdro Pascal) has his site on obtaining the relic as he believes having the ability to grant wishes will allow him to save his failing business and give him the power he craves.\r\n\r\nWith such a promising setup; the film ultimately does not deliver on its premise and becomes bogged down in drawn out sequences with surprisingly little action and gaps in logic that defy even standards for a comic book film.\r\n\r\nThe first 90 minutes of the film has roughly 10-15 minutes of action tops and we are instead given lengthy scenes of Steve trying to find an 80s fashion look; flying over fireworks, and Maxwell trashing from one locale to another without much needed continuity.\r\n\r\nAn action scene involving a convoy chase through the desert seems very inspired by \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and ultimately does not deliver especially with such a long gape between the action sequences.\r\n\r\nThe final act does attempt to redeem the film as seeing Barbara transform into her new persona is interesting and Wiig does a very solid job with the role. This sadly is undermined with a single line of dialogue which takes away a big part of the transformation that audiences deserved to see.\r\n\r\nThere was also a sequence where Diana races down the streets and takes to flight with her Lasso and then discovers she can fly like Superman. Not only is this not in keeping with the character; but we see this extended fast moving sequence where she is clearly heading away from D.C. at great speed only to arrive at a destination with an item which had been established to be back at her home in D.C.  It is this sort of sloppiness that really detracts from the film. There is also the fact that Steve has to fly her around on a jet that even as a pilot he should not know how to fly as he has never flown a jet aircraft in his life.\r\n\r\nWhen the big confrontation comes it is a letdown as it is not overly epic and the CGI really does not seem to mesh. What is an even bigger disappointment is that a certain character stands emoting for several minutes while Diana gives such a bland and extended speech that even my wife had to ask \u201cwho wrote these lines\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe film was not a total disaster as the characters were interesting and worked well with one another making the film entertaining in parts despite being really disappointed with it.\r\n\r\nThe film strikes me as a product of the talented Patty Jenkins being able to do whatever she wanted after the success of the first film. Jenkins not only Directed but did the screenplay for it. Considering the amazing job she did writing \u201cMonster\u201d I had high expectations for the film but to me it seemed like it could have used a bit more attention to several aspects.\r\n\r\nMy summary would be the following\u2026 good cast, entertaining in parts, not much action over two hours, takes huge liberties with Diana and her abilities, massive gaps in logic even for a comic movie. It aims to be epic and comes up lacking. At least the mid. credit scene was worth it.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",
        "Heroes are only as good as their villains.  Nothing sums up the disappointment of WW84 more than this.\r\n\r\nMaxwell Lord & Barbara Minerva are two of the most dangerously dark psyches in DC lore, both fond of extremely nasty, deliberately sociopathic behavior.\r\n\r\nWhoever it was pretending to be them in WW84, it wasn't those two from the comics.\r\n\r\nWe had some namby-pamby twerp called \"Max Lord\" who was just a misguided fool trying to fill that emptiness in his pathetic life with a magic dream.  Yawn.\r\n\r\nAlso, some good-hearted ditz called \"Barbara Minerva\" basically became inadvertent collateral damage whilst Lord's dopey plan panned out.  Admittedly, that's vaguely similar to one of Cheetah's later origin stories, but it completely discounts her propensity for choosing the pure evil path.\r\n\r\nIt could have been fun watching a proper mind-controlling Lord and a proper soul-possessing Cheetah fight over the \"ownership\" of some red shirt.  Alas, no.\r\n\r\nWhat an absolute WASTE of two A-grade narrative heavyweights!  But then, that's the problem.\r\n\r\nYou simply could NOT use characters like Lord & Cheetah appropriately in a movie targeted towards a family audience, and it's obvious that \"make this family friendly\" was plastered all over the script in red sharpie.\r\n\r\nNothing's likely to change for the third WW installment, where, in keeping with the cinematic PG-downgrade of supervillains, Circe is portrayed as a lonely kid's party magician who gets angry when her balloons get popped, so she turns everyone into pet unicorns.",
        "This movie is dumber than it should be. In short: it looks fantastic and the action is in perfect WONDER WOMAN style. The problems are with the plot, the attention to detail and coherence. I'm not saying this movie should be more realistic, but a lot of the decisions just don't make any sense and it is loaded to the brim with cliches (eg. ugly duckling that is not ugly at all). If you expect something to happen, it will 100%, there is no try to dig deeper - it is always the most obvious and easiest solution.  Especially the all solving \"action\" of Diana, is more than questionable and leaves so many plot-holes. \r\n\r\nIf you don't care about logic (not realism) or a challenging story this movie is perfect for you...",
        "Do not trust the reviews before Dec 25th 2020 they are bought and paid for early release reviews, this movie is bad real bad, bad CGI and horrible story shame really the first one was amazing but Patty Jenkins should just stick with directing she is just not a good writer.",
        "1984, a sequel to the fantastic \"Wonder Woman\", which showed a cool breeze in the middle of a saturated superhero cinematic market, is a fantastic continuation of the story of our favourite super heroine. Lighter in action, but thematically profound, this may not be a film that pleases everyone.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the positives: Gal Gadot, as a wonder woman, continues to prove to be the perfect choice to play the part. The actress maintains a strong bond with the audience , really showing all the strong emotions that the character feels during the course of the story. Without her, the film would lose something really essential: her soul.\r\n\r\nThe story, thematically linked to greed, our deepest desires and selfishness, provides a journey of development for the characters that makes us reassess certain attitudes taken throughout our lives.  The story seeks to develop each of the characters, and this is what gives it so much strength.\r\n\r\nChris Pine, as Steve Trevor, is also one of the film's high points, and his chemistry with Gadot remains explosive, providing the film with an engaging romance that will make anyone feel warm inside.\r\n\r\nThe film is completely different from the first, its style is radically changed, becoming lighter, like a cartoon we watched on Saturday morning as children. For some, dramatic stylistic change may be a negative factor, but in a year of so much suffering, lightness and hope are exactly what we need to abstract ourselves from real life for two hours.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to action, the film is not as explosive as first, it is contained and the action sequences, though incredible, are scarce. In a two and a half hour film, this may entice some to feel bored. But in my opinion, the film never slows down because of the incredible characters and their interactions. \r\n\r\nAs far as the most negative points of the film are concerned, I would say that the rope of suspension of credibility is really stretched during the duration of the film and we are asked to accept really ridiculous things that come out of nowhere. The film is also very cheesy, with sequences that can be considered lame and dull.\r\n\r\nAll in all, however, this film is a glimmer of hope and joy in a dark and desperate year. I strongly advise you to watch it, it's two hours of fun, with no problems and smiles in the mix. Although not perfect, and inferior to the first, this sequel is worthy of the adjective \"Wonder\".",
        "Wonder Woman 1984 is solid where it counts, maudlin in the way its fans need it to be, and, similarly, just funny enough to be charming. For all that goes unsaid, the writing is even occasionally clever.",
        "**This movie was horrible... and I realize this isnt my genre..but I sat at Christmas and watched it with my 2 grand daughters as they were sooo excited to see it..and we literally ALL hated it...  The movie itself is pointless with alot of dialogue that means nothing... no real build up to anything.. If you have to use an entire 2 hours to \"explain\" a character your probably doing something wrong.. \r\n\r\nWas SERIOUSLY disappointed in ALL the actors in it..Particularly the guy from the Chapo Netflix series.. his character was HORRIBLE... and if I am being honest..I am not impressed with this woman they have chosen as WW... not in slightest.. extremely odd looking and well... I didnt even find her acting chops good for a film like this...\r\n\r\nIt was so bad we lasted about %80 of the film befoe we stopped it and started the older one.. I'm not a fan of this actess nor this take on WW at all... **",
        "I have read the book \"1984\" and saw some aspects of the book in this movie- Big Brother, Group Think etc.  The moral dilemma that Wonder Woman faces is truly heart wrenching.  But as for the rest of the movie, there were some good action scenes and great CGI.I did notice that of all the great nations affected negatively, there was one significant one missing, China.  Why would China have been left out of the turmoil affecting the rest of the world?  Were the makers of the film afraid to show anything negative about China, but were willing to show other nations in a type of stereotypical light?  The depiction of the President of the US, who in 1984 was actually Ronald Reagan, was shown to be an insecure and to be overly ready to shoot off the nuclear warheads.  They never called him by name, but the dark hair and the jar of jelly beans were obvious who they were portraying.  The hair of the villain of the movie and his ever growing quest for power were subtle clues for another person that Hollywood has deemed a power hungry demonic person.  Ironically, the villain uses the same medium to spread his mental suggestions as the media uses to influence us to theirs.  The definite political agenda ruined some of my interest in the movie but as eye candy and brain numbing entertainment it fits the bill,    They leave the possibility of a prequel or sequel open in scenes at the end - after the credits",
        "I am not sure this is not the worst sequel of all time.  The hype surrounding the movie touted as the best movie of the year.  But, in retrospect, it fits in with the rest of the year of 2020.  Lots of hype but miserable on delivery.  The storyline was abysmal and the plotlines were weak from the start.  Just when you thought it might actually deliver a promising plot twist, it puttered out of the gate.  Really disappointed if you couldn't already tell by reading this.",
        "Wow, this movie was really bad. I quite liked the first movie and I am amazed how the writer(s), apparently with Patty Jenkins, in the lead managed to turn this into a boring piece of crud.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just so boooooring and nonsensical.\r\n\r\nBelow are my notes when watching this movie (I had to do something while watching it to not get bored out of my mind) which pretty much speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nWhat is it with the stupid beginning? It was just silly lecturing and did not really bring anything to the story.\r\n\r\nThose clowns pretending to be robbers. Was it supposed to be funny? Well it was not. Bad start indeed.\r\n\r\n25% and this is boring.\r\n\r\n40% and this is still f... boring.\r\n\r\nA guy used to fly ancient propeller planes can suddenly fly jet fighter planes. And she \"forgot\" about radar? Seriously?\r\n\r\nFlying straight through exploding fireworks and no one saw them nor did the engines get clogged up? And did they not have a world to save instead of sightseeing by the way?\r\n\r\nA fighter jet flying from the US to Cairo in one go? Yeah, right!\r\n\r\nFinally at 60% there is some action which is of course dragged down by this silly wish stone's impact on Wonder Woman.\r\n\r\nAnd here we go with the illogical emotional bullshit refusing to accept reality.\r\n\r\nMy God, the bad guy is such an unintelligent and stupid jerk. No charisma whatsoever. The script is really such a juvenile piece of crud that it is unbelievable.\r\n\r\n85% and finally some superhero action. Pretty lousy action but at least some action.\r\n\r\nHoly crap! Even the finale is boring and dragged out.\r\nThis entire movie could have been condensed into a 45 minutes TV show episode, and not a very good one at that.\r\n\r\nPatty Jenkins is going on my watch list\u2026 for movies that I will avoid!"

        "One of the best things I can say about the \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d feature movie, now streaming on HBO Max, is that it isn\u2019t wholly terrible. The animation is bright, the human cast delivers enjoyably goofy performances, and the film stays true to the original cartoon\u2019s roots. It isn\u2019t super funny nor creative, but the fun story about a celebrity wedding gone awry and a stuffy New York City hotel that employs a cat to rid them of a mouse problem lays the groundwork for a bit of amusing mayhem.\r\n\r\nBlending classic animation with live action, the effects are better than expected. The actors (including Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Pallavi Sharda, and Colin Jost) do a great job interacting with their cat and mouse counterparts, and the cartoonish elements are reminiscent of the classic Tom and Jerry of the past. The story rekindles the rivalry between the two, but is updated for modern audiences.\r\n\r\nThe physical comedy and sight gags are good for most of the giggles, but that\u2019s where the humor stops. There\u2019s also a lot of unnecessary potty humor and a few questionable plot points (the movie does little to rise above certain stereotypes) that may feel cringe-worthy to some adults.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom and Jerry\u201d isn\u2019t noteworthy at all, but it\u2019s not awful, either. There\u2019s enough here to entertain most kids for a couple of hours.",

        "Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is no \"Day 5\" (A Rooster Teeth series where people who fall asleep never wake again).  This is more like a twisted opposite of that, but still interesting.  Watching characters slowly go insane has a certain level of appeal to it when it comes to stories.  It's an onboard clock to how far the story can be pushed.\r\n\r\nThe cast does a great job of leaning into the characters and their situations, the story itself is decent, but does lean quite a bit on the concept alone.\r\n\r\nThe movie distracts from it's main plot from being about a mom and her two kids, this creates dependencies that wouldn't usually exist in apocalyptic survivor groups.  It allows for some predictability as well as limiting in what is sensible for the characters to do.\r\n\r\nThe movie compensates well enough and the bigger problem, to me is the \"special child\" trope it uses.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth a watch, and refreshing to see a somewhat innovative idea come along.",
        "Disaster movies are probably the closest type of film to being a \"guilty pleasure\" of mine. I strongly defend that every single genre has phenomenal and awful movies, all of which should be seen by audiences. Often, people ignore \"bad films\" as if they're not necessary, but without them, cinephiles wouldn't be able to truly appreciate when a gem comes around. Awake is neither, but it does feature an original idea that could have been much better explored.\r\n\r\nGina Rodriguez (Kajillionaire) is quite good as the worrying mother, but performances can only carry the movie until a certain point. Joseph Raso and Mark Raso's screenplay isn't able to develop a unique \"end-of-the-world\" concept in a surprising, captivating manner, following the generic plot points and predictable outcomes. Despite the short runtime, it still holds some pacing issues that unnecessarily drag the film. As with every other flick of this genre, questionable actions and events must be blindly accepted by the audience to avoid nitpicking logical issues.\r\n\r\nIt's still somewhat entertaining due to the genre itself, but it all feels underwhelming compared to the genuinely interesting premise.\r\n\r\nRating: C-",
        "I have always thought of myself to be imaginative in every sense of the word, but to be perfectly honest, I didn't see anything worth watching in this movie. I think the writer(s) have a deep level of darkness that they harbor in order to put such a movie to script. Bottom line, this movie was all about fear and darkness, a concept that the world needs less of in these troubled times.\u2b50"

        "Ahh, the magic begins.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10",
        "Alright first lets start with my problems with this movie.\r\nSome of the effects do not hold up and that can take away from the magic or suspense.\r\nThe child actors are not very good at acting in this movie.\r\n It is way to easy to nitpick this movie and all the nitpicks can be very distracting.\r\nI think the main theme was used way to much in the beginning and that kind of took the magic out of the main theme for me.\r\nI personally did not get sucked into this world which made me kind of bored at times.\r\nPeople love the harry potter movies but these movies don't really click with me when it comes to characters, the lore, and the magic and I think the full story of harry potter is to drawn out and I just want the movies to get to the point.\r\nFor me if the ending of the film is not very satisfying my respect for the movie drops a ton and I don't think the ending of this movie was very satisfying!\r\nThe villain in this movie is super basic.\r\nNow on to the good stuff!\r\nI like how most of the scenes build up the characters, show us some magic, and it builds up the mystery!\r\nI like the sets and costumes a lot!\r\nI like most of the music!"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nTom Clancy is the author behind the famous Jack Ryan series of books, which were eventually adapted to the big screen. While the original trilogy with Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford is fondly remembered by most people, including myself, the XXI century\u2019s reboots with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were nothing but failed attempts at reviving a movie franchise. John Krasinski\u2019s TV show was apparently successful, but unfortunately, I didn\u2019t watch it. So, why not a spin-off? Michael B. Jordan comes in for a supposedly two-part film series with John Kelly - famously known as John Clark - as the main character. Stefano Sollima rejoins forces with Taylor Sheridan - both worked on Sicario: Day of the Soldado - accompanied by the debutant co-writer, Will Staples.  \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t consider myself a Jack Ryan \u201cfan\u201d, but I do remember enjoying the first three movies. I don\u2019t possess any knowledge about the story told in the books or John Kelly himself, so I watched this Amazon Studios flick with simple expectations of receiving a decent enough action film. Overall, that\u2019s precisely what I got. The runtime under two hours flies by due to the numerous action sequences, which are obviously the most entertaining element of the entire movie. From the long takes with intense fight choreography to the more steady, suspense-driven situations, Without Remorse doesn\u2019t have extended intervals between each action set piece, which will satisfy viewers solely looking for the more energetic stuff.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work needs to be complimented. The team behind the riveting, loud, exciting action deserves to be addressed since they\u2019re the ones who truly make this type of film popular and successful. With that said, every movie requires the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters - to be well-built, which is something this film only partially accomplishes. Despite John Kelly holding a tragic, dark backstory and emotionally compelling motivations, his character arc follows the generic development formula viewers have seen previously in other movies of the same genre. Regarding the narrative, it\u2019s really no more than a direct revenge story with an inconsequential, uninteresting socio-economic, political angle, all being easily predictable from the get-go.\r\n\r\nMichael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther) delivers a remarkable physical and emotional performance, carrying the whole film on his shoulders. By incorporating his character\u2019s complicated, complex feelings of anger, grief, sadness, and sorrow, Jordan offers a captivating display that holds the viewers\u2019 attention until the very end. Unfortunately, every other actor-character combo is so far away from the efficiency of the protagonist that all are pretty forgettable. From Jamie Bell\u2019s (Rocketman, Snowpiercer) bland interpretation to Jodie Turner-Smith\u2019s (Queen & Slim) forced efforts, the scripts for every secondary character are filled with either exposition or irrelevant pieces of dialogue.\r\n\r\nClearly, this is yet another attempt to revive an action saga, which I don\u2019t think has a place today. From Mission: Impossible to John Wick, passing through Fast & Furious and the superhero universes, a Jack Ryan spin-off might just be interpreted as another random flick instead of serious competition to any of the before-mentioned franchises. Final praises to Philippe Rousselot\u2019s camera work and Matthew Newman\u2019s editing, which contributed to some impressive, entertaining scenes. In the end, that\u2019s all that matters to a massive chunk of the audience.\r\n\r\nWithout Remorse follows a compelling protagonist in a path of revenge through suspenseful, intense action sequences triggered by the usual cliches and storytelling formulas of the genre. Michael B. Jordan is the star of the show, delivering a remarkably captivating performance that helps Stefano Sollima\u2019s movie survive its unsurprising screenplay. Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples focus on building an interesting \u201chero\u201d, but forget to apply that same level of dedication to the narrative and the secondary characters. Overall, it\u2019s a fast-paced, action-driven film that will satisfy most viewers looking for something to watch on the weekend. Exceptional stunt work that must not be forgotten. However, if you desire a more creative, unique take on the Jack Ryan universe, maybe the sequel will do a better job.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
        "Better than I expected but not enough for anything higher than 3 stars...",
        "So this movie started off great and THEN FLAT LINED... Ai i had such big expectation for this movie and all it did was disappoint.Don't get me wrong Michael B is a good actor but the story itself was missing so much and became more a drama than a action thriller. but it is what it is."

        "Sometimes a story doesn't have to be sensible or original. It just has to deliver the goods - lots of guns, knuckle sandwiches, and explosions garnished with dry humour and melodrama. With Nobody, you got them all, plus a newfound action star. I watched this 2 in the morning and I had some good fun.",
        "As I have stated in other reviews, I am not a fan of action thriller movies as a genre. I have liked enough of them to make me willing to try them, but it is the exception for me to enjoy them, not the rule. So a fair action thriller is less likely to hold my attention than, say, a fair western or sci-if movie.\r\n\r\nAll that is just to say as a preamble that this movie held my attention and interest, which was all it needed to do. I gave it a try because I like Bob Odenkirk, though I must say I don\u2019t see him as an action hero.\r\n\r\nNeither the story nor the characters were particular gripping for me, but as I said, it was entertaining enough for me to stick with it, despite the excess of deaths. I am not complying about the violence,I  should clarify, just the body count. It is almost like the director came out before every scene, clapped his hands, and instead of saying \u201cHere is what I want from each of you,\u201d he asked \u201cHere is how many dead bodies I want.\u201d It is almost cartoonish. Violence can be powerful and sizzle in the viewer\u2019s gut, but when there is way too much of it, it loses its power and even its relevance.\r\n\r\nSo although I have no idea if the average action thriller crowd liked this movie, I will say that if you are not a fan of violence, action films or Bob Odenkirk, I would give it a miss.",
        "It's fun if you turn your brain off. Ilya is a master of mayhem and Odenkirk is awesome as always so even when the story sputters and stretches for cohesiveness it delivers more than enough fun action to keep you invested. That said, it does not stick the landing and the ending (no plot spoilers) was kind of a disappointment. I'm not expecting high art or even anything particularly special from a standard \"dude goes on a rampage\" narrative but for a film that started off having real impact from the fight scenes (unlike say John Wick who is basically Marvel level superhuman) it gives that up and turns our anti-hero into just another invisible character wrapped in so much plot armor it's hard to feel invested in the events that unfold.",
        "Let me put this out there first, I am a big fan of Bob Odenkirk. So my review might be more biased. Regardless of if you are a fan or not this movie was super fun. Loved the mannerism in which the ordinary life of most folks is merged with the extraordinary past life of the character.",
        "**Full Analysis at SpotaMovie.com** - When life becomes monotonous and exhausting, you need a bit of action. \u201cNobody\u201d gives you one hour and 32 minutes, intense and full of frustrations, adrenaline, and pure madness. So, is there a better way to relieve your stress? Let\u2019s find out. - **The Story** - Hutch Mansell is an ordinary man with a wife and kids. His life is not precisely exciting. His daily routine is exhausting in its boredom, and the people around him don\u2019t let shine his best qualities. Then, one night, his life changes when two thieves break into his home in the middle of the night. Inside Hutch\u2019s mind, there is now frustration, and the criticisms of the people around him make him feel useless and underestimated. To find himself, he needs to look into his past, where his life was different. So the other side of Hutch resurrects and with it the \u201cbest part\u201d of himself. A night can change everything.

        "With exceptional stunt work (Greg Rementer, Dan Skene) and remarkable directing (Ilya Naishuller), Nobody mainly works due to the surprising casting of Bob Odenkirk (Little Women) as the badass yet vulnerable protagonist. Derek Kolstad - creator of the John Wick franchise - basically writes what could easily be characterized as a spin-off of the popular action saga starring Keanu Reeves, which has its pros and cons. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, the formulaic narrative isn\u2019t unique in the slightest, holding a cliche, weak villain, and a lack of compelling characters besides the main one. On the other hand, it features insanely gory, bloody, well-choreographed fighting sequences, where Odenkirk absolutely shines - the actor performs a shockingly impressive amount of stunts. \r\n\r\nExpectations-wise, it offers the high entertainment levels audiences crave, so I can\u2019t help but recommend it.\r\n\r\nRating: B"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nOut of my Top15: Most Anticipated Movies of 2020, eight were removed from this year's schedule due to the current global pandemic, so I didn't have that many films for which I felt incredibly excited. I love pretty much everything that Pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, I noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). Onward was yet another success, but everyone knew Soul was the studio's big gun. December release date means better chances to win an Oscar, and the highly anticipated return of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up, Inside Out) to the director and writer's chairs also elevates the film's expectations.\r\n\r\nI'm no different. My expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn't really if Soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good I'd love it more than Wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? Well, let me write that it's a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. I love them both very much, and I wouldn't be surprised if I saw them in my Top10. However, this is Soul's spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue I have with the film. During the first act, I couldn't feel a connection to the story nor the characters. It took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn't negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. From the moment it clicked with me, I went on that emotional rollercoaster I always expect to ride in a Pixar feature. The studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though Soul isn't an exception to that rule, it's far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. Its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life.\r\n\r\nPete Docter, Mike Jones, and Kemp Powers explore the taboo subject of life's meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. The approach on philosophical questions like \"what's my purpose?\", \"what's my spark?\", or \"what does it mean to have a soul?\" is cleverly developed and very well-written. There's a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. I found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where I realized that what I thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories.\r\n\r\nI was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn't really what the future holds for them. They become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. Soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that I couldn't help but cry as I do in every Pixar film. Watching Soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. Living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. After a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the animation style and score didn't convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they're part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (The Social Network, Gone Girl, Mank). Pete Docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces Hollywood to the debutants Kemp Powers and Mike Jones. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. Finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film's animation. These gifted people are the real stars of Pixar.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Soul is everything I expected it to be. A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. Pete Docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of Kemp Powers and Mike Jones, and with the outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. It may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it's only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. Soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. It works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. It's the ideal movie to watch on the morning of Christmas Day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. I promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more. Undoubtedly, one of the best films of the year.\r\n\r\nRating: A",
        "This is my favorite Disney Pixar movie, even beating Monster's Inc!\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a minute where I wasn't enjoying the movie, there's very powerful meaning to this movie (that will go over kids' heads) and for once, it (in my opinion) tackles an issue big with teens and adults more than kids (at least more than usually).\r\n\r\nThe movie's message is (from what I understood it anyway) about anxiety, sadness, and fear of how you choose your life path. Even going as far as showing how you're so-called purpose in life may not even be correct (or real to begin with).\r\n\r\nThis is by the creators of Inside Out, which gave really good messages across about feelings. It was more kid-oriented, so Soul (in my opinion) being more about teens or adults was a surprise that I did not expect. I'm not saying this isn't a kids movie, I'm saying you shouldn't avoid it if you're not a kid.\r\n\r\nIt probably helps this movie that it's got it's messages across with Music as an instrument (get it?), as I too love music heavily including all kinds of genres (seriously, if you saw my YouTube music history you would think I'm somewhere between a 5-year-old girl, to a 101-year-old Beatles fan).\r\n\r\nI seriously recommend giving this one a watch.",
        "In a year where most of us have been trapped indoors, the timing of 'Soul's' release can be seen as either a blessing or a curse. For some, it will act as a calming balm for a tough year; the perfect vehicle for inducing a good cry. Others, on the other hand, may reject it as yet another unnecessary mirror held up to their biggest fears exacerbated by a year where living with perceived \u201cpurpose\u201c has been near impossible. No matter which side of this you fall on, 'Soul' implores you to find beauty and gratitude in your circumstances. There is no doubt that is by far the best film Pixar has released in years - possibly even this decade.\r\n- Ashley Teresa\r\n\r\nRead Ashley's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-soul-pixars-finest-work-in-years",
        "Soul is the latest effort by Disney Pixar, a beautiful and wonderful film that will leave anyone to ponder about life, its value and the magic inherent in existence. \r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of a man who accidentally falls into a ditch and \"dies\". However, he does not accept his death and begins a journey into his own afterlife until he is able to reunite with his body, in a coma on earth. \r\n\r\nFor a children's film, Soul is surprisingly deep, perhaps even too deep, especially for a child. The film touches on various existential themes, from purpose to the meaning of life, and will make us lose ourselves in thoughts about our own life.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a marvel, especially the protagonists, because they are complete with complex layers that give us all kinds of feelings. The voices that bring them to life do an excellent job in making all the emotions that pass through them appear. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, once again Pixar exceeds itself and brings us a film that is a living work of art, each frame a beautiful picture of colours and movement that extends for two hours. It's really magical to see life on the small screen, the realism in some of the scenes will leave the audience really amazed. \r\n\r\nThe smaller ones, however, may not understand the complexity of the film, and I don't feel that this is exactly the most entertaining film that will make them pay attention in 100% of the scenes, much due to the fact that it is not necessarily as energetic as many of the most watched animated films in recent years. It is, however, a valuable lesson that is present in the film, and letting children try to understand it will be the right choice to make when viewing Soul. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this effort by Pixar is worthwhile, wonderful, beautiful and moving. The truth is, I found myself reevaluating my whole life and pondering the fact that time is money, because time is life.",
        "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'll have to admit, I went into this thinking it would be Disney's yearly racist progressive attempt, so the bar was pretty low.\r\n\r\nThe movie is actually delightful, and shockingly deep.  The title indicates it has to do with the human soul, so I was expecting something along the lines of \"Inside\" or having to do with jazz, and while it has a rather nice combination of those two things, the attempt on the deep inner workings of the universe in the \"inbetween\" is incredible.\r\n\r\nI imagine everyone will have their own interpretations of what the movie represents mechanically, but the story itself focuses on the pursuit of dreams and happiness combined with the experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe movie animation is fantastic and the voice actors are all top shelf.  The story is awesome, and the characters are strong, deep, and interesting.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually not like the movie.\r\n\r\nThe structure is a little basic for something so fantastical, but I think that's by design to keep appeal to most audiences that expect a general family Disney format.",
        "Pleasant film.\r\n\r\n<em>'Soul'</em> didn't connect with me on any deep level, but it is an undoubtedly sweet film. It attempts a lot of heart and I respect that. Jamie Foxx has been in some of my favourite films and he is good as Joe here. I also like the casting of Graham Norton as Moonwind.\r\n\r\nOne thing that probably stopped me thoroughly enjoying this is the animation and character design, particularly when in the \"Great Beyond\". It's not that it looks bad, or anything close, but I just found it a bit too plain. I never felt attached to any of the characters or settings there. I did, though, enjoy the sounds and music, especially in the aforementioned afterlife area. They do do that nicely.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a good film and one with a nice and honourable message, I just needed that something extra to enjoy it more personally.",
        "I watched a cartoon with children. Kind and deep cartoon. I liked the humor, especially when the hero's soul moved into the cat. I recommend it for family viewing"

        "Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!\r\n\r\nYear four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! \r\n\r\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. \r\n\r\nAs is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.\r\n\r\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to horror, I'm always willing to give any film a shot, even when everything indicates it's probably going to be a massive failure. I'm admittedly not a SAW fanatic, despite quite enjoying the first two movies. After these, I can't even remember which installments I actually watched or not. Not even the most recent Jigsaw caught my attention. In preparation for Spiral, I tried to determine precisely how it would be placed in the saga's timeline, which proved to be a surprisingly challenging task. Basically, what matters for this film is that John Walker (Tobin Bell) and his work as the Jigsaw serial killer are acknowledged, making this a sequel. With that said\u2026\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Spiral doesn't change my opinion about the franchise. It's a formula-driven saga that no one really cares about too much anymore. In fact, I'm pretty shocked by the fact that this installment was even greenlit, having in mind the particularly sensitive times our society lives in. Countless movies and TV shows are held to stricter standards nowadays with the risk of getting canceled or boycotted if a certain subject is treated poorly. With so much gratuitous violence, it's surprising to see this franchise still alive. Boasting curious casting choices - Chris Rock leading a horror flick is definitely an attention-grabber - the extremely bloody, gory trap killings are packed with life-or-death dilemmas as always, which will surely please hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nHowever, these are just not as captivating or \"fun\" as before. This movie doesn't possess a single, memorable trap that surpasses any of the dozens (hundreds?) from before. Just like Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger's screenplay, it's just another lazy, unsurprising variation of a well-known formula. To be fair, and I'm trusting other critics who watched all of the other installments, this is supposedly the version that separates the most from the structure people first witnessed in 2004 and 2005. Still, being different doesn't mean better, and the competition isn't exactly defined by masterpieces. From my perspective, Spiral is just another generic take on an overdone story.\r\n\r\nFrom the repetitively identical kidnapping sequences to the consequent traps, the potential of a great film depended on how Darren Lynn Bousman (SAW II, III, IV) and the duo of writers tackled the characters, mainly the protagonist. The lack of characterization is definitely a problem, but the baffling laziness in storytelling ruins the entire flow of the movie. With an overwhelming amount of flashbacks and an incredibly choppy, annoying editing work (Dev Singh), the non-stop heightened, super tense atmosphere transforms every single scene like it's the most crucial moment of the film. Consequently, a vast majority of the dialogues are characters screaming and cursing at each other in almost every interaction.\r\n\r\nThe out-of-control tone negatively affects the cast's performances. Many people will look at Chris Rock (Dolemite Is My Name, Madagascar) and believe he's delivering an over-the-top display, but he's just following the chaotic environment established by the director. During the first minutes of the movie, Rock is amusing and funny as expected, but he's also able to tap his more dramatic side. However, when every single line of dialogue needs to be interpreted as if it's the most vital part of the film, very few actors can pull it off. Samuel L. Jackson (Glass, Spider-Man: Far From Home) is one of them, but his expectedly short screentime doesn't allow for much entertainment. Though it's always special seeing SLJ cursing at someone.\r\n\r\nFinally, SAW is also about finding out who is responsible for the disgusting game, and Spiral doesn't remove that essential block of narrative. The issue here is the lack of a jaw-dropping revelation. Obviously, this is as subjective as everything you just read until now, but I would be astonished if most viewers didn't guess who the new Jigsaw copycat is during the first act. I do want to end on a positive note, so I'll compliment the bold ending. It partially holds the studio against the wall in the sense that the probability of this movie getting a sequel being higher, which can make some viewers think it's too forced. I rather believe they just wanted to have an intense finale, which I can't really deny.\r\n\r\nSpiral might offer enough blood, gore, and brutal traps/murders to fans of the franchise, but overall it's still just another lazy, predictable take on the SAW formula. Despite the violently captivating life-or-death sequences, none stands out as an unforgettable moment. Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger's screenplay lacks efficient character development, impactful revelations, and, honestly, a massive amount of creativity. From the repetitively tiresome flashbacks and kidnapping scenes to the extremely out-of-control tone, Darren Lynn Bousman isn't able to take the story to its potential. Everything is dialed up to its maximum as if every single line of dialogue needs to be screamed from the top of a mountain, which transforms the entire atmosphere into a chaotic environment. Chris Rock can't be the only one to blame for his over-tense line deliveries, especially when he starts so well. A strong yet abrupt ending doesn't compensate for such dull storytelling. I wish I could write that I'm disappointed, but I didn't have high expectations for this one.\r\n\r\nRating: D+",
        "The latest entry into the Saw series has a couple okay moments but otherwise this was pretty bad. The acting was probably the worst culprit, chiefly Chris Rock who sprinkles in his comedic rants while Samuel L. Jackson phones it in, not that he's given a whole lot to work with (including a hilariously bad fake mustache for a flashback scene). It's also really predictable as I called who the killer was early on.\r\n\r\nI'm okay with taking the series in a different direction as there was nowhere else to go with Jigsaw (and they stretched his story out a few movies too many) but this was a misfire. **2.0/5**"

So glad I did.  It turned out to be a heartwarming, well animated, expertly acted gem.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to think that this is a simple re-telling of the Arabian Aladdin story but in a Chinese setting, yet it's so much more than that. Indeed, a little research shows that the Aladdin tale originated in China.  Instead, it's a well woven story of promises lost and refound, the value and endurance of real friendships, the importance (or lack thereof) of monetary riches and the true meaning of success in life. \r\n\r\nAnimation and other production values are superb and polished, characters are eminently likeable (sometimes quite loveable!) and believably evil in equal parts.  \r\n\r\nIt's an hour and a half of pure joy. It has a warm, wholesome, fuzzy feeling in the same vein that The Iron Giant once did.  Even for a cynical old sci-fi addicted geek like myself.  \r\n\r\nHighly recommended."

It did not create that stupid love triangle between Gwen and Mary Jane, betraying everything Peter Parker is supposed to be about.\r\n\r\nThese were fundamental issues in the script and direction the film took.

        "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nWhile this was casted really well and the actors all did a great job, what makes this movie for me is the structure.  It doesn't really do anything special, but for that sacrifice they do 3-4 parallel arcs.\r\n\r\nFor slasher fans, there is a lot of fun here, and the bodies hit the floor all over in a spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\nReally trying not to spoil anything, I can only point to a handful of features where there are multiple survival situations in play at once.  Its a special kind of intensity that obscures what's going to happen next.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a telegraph of a sequel / series in the title, they do an excellent job of wrapping up the story to move forward to the next feature."

        "A lot was changed in this remake and I thought it would irk me. After about twenty minutes I thought I had been wrong, the opening had some originality and it seemed like something fresh. then they arrived at the Hotel and Anne Hathaway came on the scene like a wrecking ball. Any potential that this movie had was suffocated by Hathaways incredibly poor performance. Watch Anjelica Huston's performance in the original and you will see the MASSIVE difference in ability. Hathaway's performance is akin to an amateur impressionist. It feel more like an insult than an homage by Hathaway, she put zero effort or spirit into this character. Her accent is atrocious and her presence is almost nonexistent. Also the CGI already looks cheap, c'mon they had better puppets in the 80's. All witches now have joker smiles and shark teeth? This could've really been a good movie and it is just marred by an extremely poor performance from the lead villain, an overuse of cheap effects, poor pacing, lack of originality in the second half and a horrendous ending. The only highlights of this movie are Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno who do a fantastic job of filling and updating their roles. Unfortunately as most fans know, Jahzir spends the second half of the movie as a poorly CGI'd mouse. Leaving Octavia Spencer to carry the entirety of the movie from there on out almost seems like a cruel prank. Tucci is decent as is Codie Eastwick as Bruno but there characters are so poorly written and used they practically add nothing. The addition of a third mouse is also meaningless and changes nothing in the story. Ultimately this movie is a far worse version of the first one. They actually managed to tell less of the story, give characters less development, and have worse effects than a movie made over 30 years ago. Some of this may have been forgivable if they added any decent original concepts but again this is a poor retread with no added substance. Its disheartening to see so many big names attached to this film. Guillermo Del Toro should not put this on his IMBD page. Of course your children will like it, they like Peppa Pig.",
        "When you hear the names Robert Zemeckis, Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron, you expect something visually engaging. These three names paired with Dahl's work could have been something really special, but this is just another bland adaption. The more you compare it to both the source material and previous adaptions, it comes across as bland and missing the mark. The same could be said about the star-studded cast led by Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, with Stanley Tucci playing the forgettable hotel owner. This team really could have made something unique, but this is not it, witch.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-witches-horrifying-for-all-the-wrong-reasons",
        "Is a good movie for family. The end is unexpected and Anne Hatheway is always a good choice in distribution.",
        "Unlike what a lot of people seems to think about this movie I though it was a fairly decent family movie. It\u2019s not great but decent enough. I quite enjoyed it at least.\r\n\r\nThe story is what it is. It is a Roald Dahl story so it is somewhat dark but funny and with some light at the same time. Of course there are a bunch of whiners complaining that it is too dark and not suited for children. Well, everyone knows (or should now) what to expect from a Roald Dahl story so just go and see another movie then. My kids, even when they where younger, would have no problem with this movie. But then I would spend the time to watch it with them. It is called parenting.\r\n\r\nThe beginning felt a wee bit slow perhaps but once the grand witch, and in particular the three mice, entered the scene it became rather funny.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I did not like that much was the over the top silly acting of the witches, especially the grand witch. They could really have toned down that it bit to make her a bit more scary. Now she just became silly and somewhat annoying.\r\n\r\nThe special effects were quite nice. The mice was a bit cartoonish but that was okay for this movie. I quite liked how the grand witch\u2019s mouth split open from time to time to reveal her \u201cwitchiness\u201d.\r\n\r\nApparently a bunch of disability advocates,  including British Paralympic swimmer Amy Marren, got unhinged and claimed the movie was \u201cperpetuating bias against individuals with ectrodactyly and other limb differences.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeriously? Get a grip. It is fiction and a family movie about witches for Christ sake! Presenting witches or other supernatural creatures as having \u201cabnormalities\u201d like crows feet, fangs and God knows what is what makes witches. If these obsessive whiners and cancel culture freaks would have their way no movie worth watching and no book worth reading would ever be made.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I felt it was an hour and 45 minutes that I enjoyed."

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least \"liked\" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: \"I like this part that's not in the original\". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...\r\n\r\nI can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.\r\n\r\nFinally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.\r\n\r\nHer courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.\r\n\r\nLike I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the \"be yourself\" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.\r\n\r\nThe ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...\r\n\r\nRating: C-",
        "Disappointing watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.\r\n\r\nI finally see what everyone is freaking out about this movie.  Mostly, it is because it just left all the spirit of the first movie behind and started over. \r\n\r\nThey made a conscious effort to ditch the goofiness, and magic animals of the first one to do a more gritty and real version, like a DC movie.  After those decisions, they also chose to reintroduce actual magic, but mostly for the villains, who had slightly better women's rights(?).\r\n\r\nI'll be honest, the movie itself wasn't interesting enough to follow completely.  For instance, I know \"Mushu\" was replaced with a phoenix, but I have no idea what happened to it.\r\n\r\nMulan also is outed much sooner in this, but basically skirts execution about 3 different times because of her accomplishments with a much more laid back atmosphere than it was in the 1998 version.\r\n\r\nDespite all the money poured into the movie that keeps it from being a bad movie, it just doesn't feel good.  While it is wonderous at times, it just lacks the heart warming charm that one would expect from a Disney movie."

        "The theme of the movie is pulling the family feeling out of you. The acting of kevin is nice as always, but there is few details the director miss to include. Kevin hair style always goood!! **where is the busy father raising his daughter**. Few moments of his wife is not enough i never felt attached to his wife dead rather then what will happen with his relationship about arguments and struggling.. overall is nice to watch, it can be boring few minutes.",
        "There are many films about parenthood, but Fatherhood caught my attention due to the main actor and the director. Kevin Hart (Jumanji: The Next Level) is one of the most recognizable, famous faces in comedy, so seeing him bring it down to portray a more grounded character dealing with an emotionally devastating moment in life is captivating, to say the least. In addition to this, Paul Weitz, one of the directors of American Pie, is directing this Netflix flick. How can someone not feel remotely interested in watching the final result?\r\n\r\nFatherhood may go through the usual plot developments and character building of the genre, but Hart offers a brilliant performance as the compelling protagonist who will grab every viewer's attention. The actor proves yet again that he isn't a one-trick pony, seamlessly incorporating the complex feelings of his character. From losing the woman he loves to raising a child on his own, the accumulated emotions keep the movie worth investing in. Alfre Woodard (The Lion King) is terrific as always, but Lil Rel Howery (Judas and the Black Messiah) isn't really able to overcome the script issues when it comes to the comedic bits.\r\n\r\nThe jokes themselves are acceptable, but they're often inserted at the wrong moment. There are many scenes where a joke could have helped lighten the heavy, depressing atmosphere, but they're saved for dialogues that don't require them. Howery is usually hilarious, but in this film, his character genuinely feels a bit irritating. Despite the overlong stay, it's a movie I can see helping a lot of parents in similar situations while being entertaining and enlightening at the same time for other viewers.\r\n\r\nRating: B-"

        "A semi-welcome return. Not the greatest horror film to hit theater screens this year but certainly not the worst. It unfortunately lacks the finality that the original had but still proves to be an effective entry in a franchise known for its inconsistency in quality.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t call myself a fan of the franchise but I am a fan of the original film and this sequel transfers the formula made famous by said film pretty well to a Generation Z audience. There are plenty of callbacks to the first entry (one of the victims even being a babysitter) and they all work incredibly well.\r\n\r\nThere unfortunately isn\u2019t that much tension. Most, if not all of the scares are executed brilliantly but the fights between Michael Myers and his victims are pretty disappointing. The gore is awesome; can\u2019t really complain much about that.\r\n\r\nSubplots are handled poorly; despite already being in motion, they end pretty quickly which is a letdown. Writing is fine..good, not great. Humor is handled well though. Serviceable to fans new and old. It\u2019s evident that Blumhouse knows how to make horror movies and that\u2019s the big takeaway here.\r\n\r\nThe new score is brilliant. One of the best I\u2019ve heard all year, in fact.\r\n\r\nEnjoyable. Would recommend overall.",
        "The unfortunately named _Halloween_ has been released, and in doing so has created an entirely new **fifth** timeline in the _Halloween_ franchise. It's a decent timeline this one, makes a lot of sense. Not perfect, pretty expected run of events, but yeah, good.\r\n\r\nGonna throw myself under the bus once more by yet again mentioning my love for the Rob Zombie _Halloween_ films, but here goes anyway: Seems interesting that a decent chunk of the same people who hate those Rob Zombie movies (99% of all horror fans), love this movie, despite some scenes in the 2018 _Halloween_ seemingly being ripped straight from Mr. Zombie himself.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
        "So we're all totally just going to ignore Laurie had a teenage son twenty years ago?",
        "\"A worthy successor\"\r\n\r\n40 years after the events in \u2018Halloween\u2019 (1978) Laurie Strode faces off once again with Michael Myers.\r\n\r\nStrode has been preparing for 4 decades for an eventual showdown with Myers. Of course Michael escapes and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the 2 meet. Strode\u2019s doomsday prepper storyline is a bit far-fetched but that doesn\u2019t make it less entertaining. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphant return as Laurie Strode. It also marks the return of Nick Castle as Michael Myers. And Myers lives up to his reputation. His killings are more brutal than ever.\r\n\r\nDirector David Gordon Green executes it almost perfectly. A lot of killings happen offscreen but you get to see the horror afterwards. And there\u2019s of course the delicious tracking shot where Myers returns to Haddonfield. The camera follows him through a suburban home where he slaughters someone. The camera follows him back onto the street and into the next house to kill again. Michael\u2019s introduction in the psych ward is also pretty memorable when all the psychos start to go\u2026 psycho. After that sequence we get the opening credits with the iconic theme. Brilliant.\r\n\r\nCredit has to go to writer Danny McBride. He respects the original, as is obvious in the countless references (Laurie standing in front of the window, Michael missing an eye) but isn\u2019t afraid to give it a spin. Who\u2019s hunting who? There\u2019s also the humor he brings to the story. And it works (the babysitting scene).\r\n\r\nOf course it\u2019s not all great. At times \u2018Halloween\u2019 falls victim to several genre tropes (girl falling when chased, questionable decisions). And although Strode\u2019s been preparing for 40 years she doesn\u2019t do a top notch job.\r\nThe biggest letdown was the character of Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). He\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Dr. Loomis whose role is too expanded.\r\n\r\nAll in all David Gordon Green and Danny McBride finally make up for 40 years of mediocrity and less (Halloween: Resurrection says boo). Although the 2018 version will not achieve the same cult status as the original it\u2019s a solid entry in a disappointing franchise.",
        "\"Halloween\" basically ignores all but the first movie. Think of the way that various Godzilla reboots worked. It's an interesting approach and does wipe out the atrocious \"Halloween: Resurrection\" from continuity, at the very least.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to like this movie a lot more, being a big fan of John Carpenter's original, but I can only say it's okay or fair. It starts out pretty strong, with an unsettling opening scene and elements like the title sequence being a direct homage to the original film (\"Halloween III\" playing on a TV is great call back to the first \"Halloween\" playing on a TV in \"Halloween III\") but some questionable choices get made and it seems to lose its way as the movie progresses. The characterizations of several characters are inconsistent, switching back and forth between badass and panicky. The lead teenage character who we think the torch is going to be passed to just doesn't cut it. And the end is quicker than I would have expected, feeling a little unsatisfying and reminiscent of \"H20\".\r\n\r\nSee it if you're a fan of the series. Other may be left feeling a little letdown.",
        "The best sequel/reboot of the Halloween series. John Carpenter returns as executive producer and sound director leaving the directing to David Gordon Green of \"Pineapple Express\" and  \"Joe.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie does a great job of connecting to and playing homage to the original  (there are many easter eggs to find) while injecting an original story around the distraught Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, an unbelievable plot twist late distracts from the stronger main plot line. If you can forgive that one sin, you'll enjoy the Halloween reboot tremendously."

        "I actually like Ruby Rose, not a great actress for sure but can be entertaining but she seemed to have quickly devolved into direct-to-video territory with this and her previous film, The Doorman, neither would've gotten a theatrical release even without COVID-19. Anyway, this one could've been passably entertaining if not for the terrible editing, atrocious photography (not sure what was with the green tint or over-saturation of colors in other scenes.\r\n\r\nAlso doesn't help it was predictable.

        "This was one of the most painful movies to watch in recent memory, and I watch ALOT of movies. It was more like watching a school film project- from high school. The dialogue consisted of short one-line exchanges, the action and tension were non-existent, the acting is amateurish, the plot paper-thin and overly-convoluted. In fact, the photography and atmosphere were so overly-styled, that they clearly spent FAR more time and money worrying how it was going to look than on the actual story/screenplay. Looong scenes of motorcycle riding, so there's that for any enthusiasts. So much time spent on it, that the short and pointless scenes with people in them seemed to be there just as a jump point to another motorcycle scene. Any vaguely interesting moment was put in the trailer, so if you're still interested, you could probably just watch that and save 1 hour and 31 minutes of your life that you'll definitely want back."

Things haven\u2019t been the same since the rumors about missing children (and evil animatronics) took over the town. As the night progresses, the man discovers that the life-sized fuzzy mascots have minds of their own, and he must fight to the death in order to survive to see the sun rise.\r\n\r\nThe story is solid all around and if you suspend disbelief, the plot is actually plausible. There are supernatural elements and lots of humor, and the Janitor is the horror hero we didn\u2019t know we needed. Kevin Lewis has a terrific eye for direction, a natural at knowing exactly what the audience wants to see and how they want to see it (and delivering just that). The pacing is excellent, too. The film ends with a set-up for an eventual sequel that I really, really hope happens.\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate word I can find to describe this movie, and one that fits in almost any discussion of the film, is \u201crad.\u201d The awesome, primitive puppet costumes for Willy the Weasel and his tribe of murderous pals (Tito the Turtle, Siren Sara, Ozzie the Ostrich, and Knighty Knight, to name a few) are absolutely hysterical, the perfect pair for the equally amusing low budget horror effects. Even better is Cage, who brings that certain je ne sais quoi to his character, a soda-guzzling, pinball-loving man of few words (the actor doesn\u2019t speak any dialogue in the movie).\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a movie that you\u2019re supposed to take seriously, and that\u2019s what adds to its charm. \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d is tons of bloody fun, especially if you want to watch Nic Cage beat the shit out of possessed serial killer animatronics. And quite frankly, isn\u2019t that all of us?"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI still can't believe I'm about to write a review for The New Mutants... The last X-Men movie before they're introduced into the MCU became one of the most delayed films ever, but it finally got released this week. Shot in 2017 with an original release date of April 2018, Josh Boone had reshoots planned, which postponed the movie for the first time. Disney began negotiations to merge with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), keeping the film in a limbo state. A global pandemic emerged, pushing the movie even further. Final outcome: a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting, and without any reshoots. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty low...\r\n\r\nSurprise, surprise, The New Mutants isn't a horrible mess, it's... fine! I feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world. I love how it's far from being just another generic, formulaic superhero flick. Sure, it has tons of cliches, and it does still feel like an X-Men movie at times, but I'll get there. I genuinely appreciate that Boone and Knate Lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development, including a compelling romantic arc. Every young mutant gets their own story explained front-center. Each time the film dives into a character's past, it never feels like an irrelevant subplot. It all serves a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre, so I must praise them for transforming a small, one-location film into something surprisingly entertaining. The visual effects definitely don't have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now, but they're reasonably okay for the most part. The horror atmosphere is definitely present, but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive, bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences. The best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast, with just one exception...\r\n\r\nFrom Anya-Taylor Joy's rebel behavior to Charlie Heaton's experienced performance, passing through Maisie Williams' emotional display and Henry Zaga's charming one-liners, every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a well-known franchise. Despite the ridiculously flawed accents, all share great chemistry between each other, including debutant Blu Hunt. However, the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience. I don't want to be too harsh on her because I did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues. However, I do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringe-worthy levels of bad acting.\r\n\r\nBoone and/or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character, but honestly, she's not even my main issue. That has to do with her own character. While she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory, she never really has to deal with her powers' consequences. Some mutants hurt or killed people, and they're unquestionably damaged because of it. Dani doesn't have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where she's confronted with it. It's quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality.\r\n\r\nFinally, Alice Braga, as the doctor, is probably the most formulaic component of the movie. From the first conversation she has with the mutants, any viewer can guess where the story is going. Braga is good as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, but coincidentally or not, her character is the only one whose backstory wasn't remotely explored. Reyes' motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that, unfortunately, never get answered. Maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues, perhaps they could have added some more. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that The New Mutants is far from being an awful mess.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Josh Boone and Knate Lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre, packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences, especially having in mind the low budget. The New Mutants features a marvelous cast, where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other. All actors deliver great performances, except for the debutant Blu Hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential. Contrasting with the overall character treatment, Dani Moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since she's barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does. Despite the refreshing take on the overall story, there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film, especially related to the hospital. Overall, it's surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues, so I definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last X-Men installment pre-MCU.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
        "Just like 'Dark Phoenix', Fox's greatest loss is Disney's greatest gain: even as 'The New Mutants' opened, the discussion was already focused on how Disney's MCU is bound to resuscitate 'X-Men'. That's a shame because Josh Boone's relic from a defunct franchise, unceremoniously dumped in cinemas in the middle of pandemic, was a step in a potentially interesting new direction.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-new-mutants-an-enjoyably-small-scale-superheroic-character-piece",
        "The problem with The New Mutants is that it fails in so many different areas that's its difficult to pin point why it's such a bad movie. If you're a X-Man fan you'll be disappointed by the main characters mutations, if you're a thriller fan you'll be disappointed by the villain.\r\n\r\n**When to watch:** The only scenario I would recommend you watch this movie is if you are die hard fan of one of the actors (Even still you might be disappointed)\r\n\r\n**How to fix this movie:**\r\n\r\n1. Replace the villain, stop trying to make this a weird horror crossover and focus on what made X-Man good to begin with. A PROPER VILLAIN.\r\n2. Far to much focus on the poorly written backstory for each main character.\r\n3. Make the Mutations better! The super powers should make the audience want to be them.\r\n4. Cut the cheesy dialogue and pick a clear genre, this is a toss up between, Sci-Fi, Action, Horror, Romance, Cheesy B Level Movie.",
        "As both a horror and X-men fan, I was looking forward to this mashup since the first trailer dropped. Even recently with mostly bad reviews and press, I wanted to see it for myself. \r\n\r\nAnd ... it pretty much sucked. That doesn't bode well for future work from Josh \"The Fault in my Stars\" Boone (e.g. \"The Stand\" mini-series. \r\n\r\nWe pretty much know the gist from the trailers. Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital. \r\n\r\nThe best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy. \r\n\r\nMost of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (\"Game of Thrones\"), Anya Taylor-Joy (\"The Witch/Queen's Gambit\"), and Charlie Heaton (\"Stranger Things\") but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively). \r\n\r\nAnd the story -- disappointing to say the least. \r\n\r\nIf you drop your expectations to a bad 90 minute \"Buffy the Vampire\" episode, then maybe you'll find something to like.",
        "Surprisingly great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nMy expectations of this one were rock bottom: I honestly didn't think much of the trailer.  I thought they were ruining \"The New Warriors\", my mistake, and I didn't realize they gender bent a character I was already familiar with.  (Moonstar is basically another guy character from \"The Initiative\" in Marvel Comcs)\r\n\r\nWhat is really interesting, and NEVER ADDRESSED is what the facility is, who runs it, and what the point is.  There just aren't answers to be had so simply during an uprising.  Honestly worst part of the movie, but unless you're paying too much attention, you probably won't even notice.\r\n\r\nThe characters are deceptively interesting, to the point where I was actually surprised at certain points, but they are what makes the movie.  The discovery of the characters, they're evolution as a team, and their personal struggles are what makes the movie great.\r\n\r\nIt is also FILLED with action after a certain point, beautifully rendered and weighted combat with something somewhat meaningful behind it.\r\n\r\nIf you're into super powered action on any level, then give this a watch."

        "Another forgettable Game of Ender/Hunger Games/Divergent clone.\r\n\r\nIn this case, to compensate that the main characters are often women, we just make the whole cast to be men.\r\n\r\nJust forget about this.",
        "It was a good movie as far as it goes -- resourceful characters deprived of both freedom and their memories manage to build a society and think their way out of their bondage.  The problem is that at the end, it simply stopped.  No dramatic reason for ending where it does, no resolution of \"why did the captors do this?\" .  Even in a series a movie ought to have a decent local climax -- for example,  Kat and Peeta winning the Hunger Games.",
        "One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a \u201cyoung adult\u201d movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:",
        "Don't bother.",
        "Much better than the marketing would have you assume.\r\n\r\n_Final rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._"

        "Adapting a series of books into a movie is often a daunting task. As anyone who has seen many Stephen King adaptations can attest; plot complexity, characters, and depth are removed in order to condense the story into a two-hour or less run time.\r\n\r\nThe rise of streaming services has allowed many books to be adapted into series without having to cut much of the adult content in the books which would make it difficult for network television.\r\n\r\nAs such it makes adaptations such as \u201cChaos Walking\u201d a delicate undertaking. The film is based on a series of books and stars Tom Holland as Todd; a young ma living on a distant world where there are no women and people can hear and see each other\u2019s thoughts by a process known as \u201cNoise\u201d.\r\n\r\nTheir rustic colony is run with a firm hand by their Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen); who keeps those around him from seeing his thoughts which gives him a big advantage over those who rule.\r\n\r\nWhen a landing craft from a mothership filled with a new wave of colonists crashes on the planet; Todd is shocked to find that the only survivor is a woman named Viola (Daisy Ridley) whose arrival disrupts the community.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor wishes to keep her from contacting her ship so they can seize it when it lands to maintain control of his empire as he sees the arrival of new individuals as a threat to his power.\r\n\r\nTodd and Viola escape trying to reach a distant colony where she hopes to find a way to warn her ship about the danger the Mayor and his men present and they pursue the duo to keep this from happening.\r\n\r\nThe film lightly touches on the native race that Todd believes killed all the women of their colony but they are not visited save for a brief appearance. It is clear that the Mayor is hiding something and the reveal of what and why is fairly underwhelming which reduces him and most of his followers as thinly developed stock characters.\r\n\r\nThere is also the mystery as to why the Mothership does not bother to do any sort of follow up when they did not hear from their lander and like many aspects of the film; require the audience to simply go along with things and not ask too many questions to make things work.\r\n\r\nThankfully the two leads are interesting enough and they hold attention even when the story is slowly moving along with scene after scene of rivers, woods, and a little conversation.\r\n\r\nOne big issue with the film is the Noise as the visualization of thoughts as well as hearing them mixed in with verbal communication can get very confusing as it is like multiple voices in a crowded room.\r\n\r\nDespite the issues, the potential is there and I found myself wondering what was next for the characters and hope that they do adapt future books in the series.  While the film on its own does not work as a fully developed story\u2019 as an introduction to the series it does enough to peak the interests for more.\r\n\r\n3.5 out of 5",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAfter decades of experiencing so many films and understanding the respective industry, I rarely get extremely excited for an original sci-fi movie starring famous actors. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Chaos Walking is the most anticipated film of the month for thousands of viewers, which isn\u2019t an easy decision having in mind March is releasing tons of highly expected movies, such as Raya and the Last Dragon, Cherry, Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, Godzilla x Kong, amongst others. It\u2019 almost impossible not to feel remotely interested in watching a film with such a phenomenal cast - Tom Holland (Spider-Man, The Devil All the Time), Daisy Ridley (Star Wars, Murder on the Orient Express), Mads Mikkelsen (Doctor Strange, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), Demi\u00e1n Bichir (Land, The Grudge), Cynthia Erivo (Widows, Bad Times at the El Royale), and more.\r\n\r\nAdd Doug Liman (The Bourne franchise, The Edge of Tomorrow) as the director and screenwriters with tremendously successful credits as Patrick Ness (A Monster Calls) and Christopher Ford (Spider-Man: Homecoming), what could go wrong? Well\u2026 almost everything. I possess no knowledge of the source material, but from what I could gather, the book trilogy of the same name was very well-received, which I don\u2019t doubt for a second. If there\u2019s one thing no one can take away from Chaos Walking is its incredibly captivating concepts and imaginative visual ideas. From the premise of people being able to hear men\u2019s thoughts (noise) to the actual visuals of said brain activity, I felt deeply invested during the first act.\r\n\r\nThe futuristic setting is somewhat familiar, but the production/set design definitely set an engaging atmosphere. The score (Marco Beltrami, Brandon Roberts) also features interesting tracks that create a sense of wonder in this new world. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. Sure, the cast offers remarkable performances, especially Holland and Ridley, who obviously share most of the screentime as the underdeveloped protagonists, but sadly this is one of those movies where it\u2019s hard not to find a significant flaw with everything. The lack of proper characterization is one of the main issues. While Holland\u2019s character misses a regular arc - he has no evolution whatsoever, ending the film with the exact same defects as in the beginning - Ridley\u2019s character raises dozens of questions that remain unanswered about herself, her past, her abilities, and her origins.\r\n\r\nThe new world presented to the viewers packs hundreds of unquestionably innovative and exciting ideas, but none reaches even a fraction of its potential. The \u201csuperpower\u201d of hearing thoughts is rarely seen in a different manner other than chaotic, annoying noise, which is hugely disappointing, having in mind the scarce showings of its real power. Nevertheless, the most frustrating component of the narrative is the introduction of massively important story elements that are completely forgotten by the end of the movie, namely - without getting into spoilers - an entire native population that remains as one of the most fascinating aspects of the screenplay that wasn\u2019t remotely explained.\r\n\r\nNowadays, people have more knowledge and understanding of how much studios impact the production of any film. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if this is one of those projects ruined by awfully dumb corporate demands or if Doug Liman and his team of writers screwed the pooch. One thing is for sure: director, screenwriters, and/or producers, they\u2019re the people to blame for such a frustratingly terrible adaptation. I apologize to Doc Crotzer, but this is one of the worst editing jobs I\u2019ve seen in years, though I want it to be clear: Crotzer is far from being the sole or main culprit of such a horribly put-together movie. The camera work is also all-over-the-place (Ben Seresin).\r\n\r\nFinally, I don\u2019t know if this following story detail is as explicit and barely explained in the source material as it is in this film, but due to the lack of any decent explanation besides \u201cbecause\u201d, I strongly dislike the whole \u201ceveryone can hear men\u2019s thoughts, but no one can hear the women\u2019s\u201d. To be clear, my issue isn\u2019t related to the idea but to its evolution in this movie. Men, especially Holland\u2019s character, are shown to think like a primate with sexual thoughts concerning women and offenses to everyone and everything. Men\u2019s thoughts represent them as utter pigs. However, the whole \u201cwomen\u2019s thoughts are hidden from everyone\u201d can easily be interpreted as \u201cwomen don\u2019t have brains\u201d, especially considering the film\u2019s failed attempt at elaborating this concept.\r\n\r\nChaos Walking will end up as one of the most disappointing, frustrating movies of the year. In addition to this, it\u2019s also another entry in the list of \u201cfilms with innovative, interesting concepts that fail to reach half of their potential\u201d. Besides the engaging production design, a cool score, and decent performances, any viewer will struggle not to find a massive flaw in every single aspect of the narrative. From the dozens of unanswered questions regarding Daisy Ridley\u2019s character to the lack of a proper arc for Tom Holland\u2019s role, the underdeveloped protagonists are just one of many screenplay issues. Critical plot points and story elements either miss an explanation or are entirely forgotten by the end of a horrendously edited movie. Transitions between cuts are very choppy and make zero connection between storylines. The whole \u201cmen\u2019s thoughts are seen by everyone, but women\u2019s thoughts are not\u201d is depicted in a way that leaves men portrayed as pigs and insinuates women have no brains. I genuinely don\u2019t know if this massive disaster is due to studio interference and/or to the director and screenwriters team-up, but one thing is for certain: personally, it's one of the worst films of the year.\r\n\r\nRating: D+",
        "It should first be noted I have never read (or even heard of) the novel this was based upon, so I don't have any preconceptions or expectations on how the adaptation was handled. With that out of the way, I found this to be... fine. A little messy in narrative and structure but I suppose moderately entertained. I also liked Tom Holland in the lead for the most part and Daisy Ridley grew on me though her character isn't very well developed. It's probably worthy of a rental but doubtful I'll revisit this very soon other than to listen to the commentary by Doug Liman considering the behind-the-scenes issues and major re-shoots. **3.0/5**"

        "Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.\r\n\r\nIt has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10"

        "What can I say about this movie, its amazing! full of explosions and action. The setting is slightly different than other terminator films but I like this new \"survival\" setting more so than the older terminators. Terminator 2 was and always will be my favourite terminator movie but this one sure comes close, defiantly my second favourite terminator movie.\r\n\r\nThere is only so much a review can tell you but this is a must watch movie for any one who has not seen it yet.",
        "worst of the terminator series",
        "What can I say about Terminator Salvation? It's a decent addition to the Terminator series, but has major issues. Some would say that it is the worst of the series, but I disagree. T3 will always hold that top honor for me. \r\n\r\nIt was nice to see the return of Kyle Reeese. It was a different look at a character that was forgotten to quickly. John Connor was a bit stale and I wanted way from his character. \r\n\r\nIt was nice to see this future everyone spoke about in past films, Problem was this film felt darker than all the others, excluding T1. The first film was pretty dark but had a storyline And an R Rating to back that up. This film just didn't feel like it belonged to the Terminator world. And a few nostalgic lines and visuals did nothing to make it feel like it was part of the franchise. \r\n\r\nAll of that being said, the film still had some decent action scenes and some interesting moments. It's not bad, but its not fantastic either.",
        "I know that even amongst the rocky track record of the _Terminator_franchise, _Terminator Salvation_ is not especially well-liked. I've always been a little bit of an outlier when it came to this series though; like everyone else, I know the first two are the only great ones, but to me, it's actually not _T2_ that stands at the top of the pile, but _The Terminator_, the first film. And since that first film, we've copped 5 new runs at a _Terminator_ movie. Out of all 5 of them, _Salvation_ is the only one that tried something different from the first one. Even the lofty success of _T2_ was garnered using the same core concept as the original movie. _Salvation_ hits something new, and while that obviously doesn't work for a lot of its audience, for me, it's the best movie outside of the first two that the franchise has made to date.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
        "_**Wall-to-wall post-apocalyptic action needed more time to breathe**_\r\n\r\nThe first couple of Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmakers\u2019 decision to set this fourth installment (2009) in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.\r\n\r\nA few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI face, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand are: Conner's mate, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter in a peripheral role.\r\n\r\nOn the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is that there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that strings together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, but we barely know them and therefore hardly care. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfires due to overkill. That's why they call it \"overKILL.\" It's a curious thing but all too true.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, there are enough positive elements in \u201cTerminator Salvation\u201d to make it worth checking out if you\u2019ve seen the first two films. For instance, Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until he is informed otherwise. At around the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between two characters sharing a warm moment in a world gone mad. The film would have been more effective if it contained more scenes like this. But there's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters. Meanwhile Bryce Dallas Howard has a uniquely beautiful face (although she\u2019s pregnant throughout the story). There are also some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.\r\n\r\nBottom line, if you love action, you'll get it here. There are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots and Schwarzenegger-bots, all trying to terminate the protagonists. Since the events take place in a post-apocalyptic world it\u2019s reminiscent of films like \u201cBeneath the Planet of the Apes\u201d (1970), \u201cMad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\u201d (1985) and, especially, \u201cReign of Fire\u201d (2002), albeit with constant outrageous thrills.\r\n\r\nThe first two films in the series successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. \"Terminator Salvation,\" on the other hand, only captivates marginally in preference for wall-to-wall action. That's too bad, but it has its moments; it's thankfully not as bad as \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nHere's how I grade each of the Terminator outings (I have yet to see the sixth one):\r\n\r\nT1: A+\r\n\r\nT2: A+\r\n\r\nT3: B+\r\n\r\nT4: B-\r\n\r\nT5: C+"

Ripping brains out of human heads to use as bio PCs for alien androids is just odd.

        "Maybe you have to be a bit more of a science fiction fan than most to like this movie but, personally, I do not really understand why its ratings seems to be so poor? Sure it is not great but I rather enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThe movie takes place a few years after the second movie, Beyond Skyline, in the franchise. A bit sad that they chose to have a rather apocalyptic setting where humanity really didn\u2019t seem to have benefited from their new \u201callies\u201d nor from the technology they actually acquired in the previous movie.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the writers also decided to go with a really standard Hollywood villain in the psychopathic, out of control, kill everything General Radford. Hollywood\u2019s choices of bad guys are unfortunately rather limited in these agenda driven days.\r\n\r\nIf we overlook the poor bad guy and the poor plot that resulted from that choice (not sure which came first, the silly plot or the poor bad guy though) then what remains is really a very decent action movie with a fair amount of cool special effects.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a fair amount of action. Both martial arts ones and the more trigger happy variety. The space scenes are also not bad at all and the monsters, well of course the old \u201cbaddies\u201d are back and they added a few more varieties.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I quite enjoyed the movie. Sure, it doesn\u2019t really put too much load on the viewers\u2019 brains but still, it is a quite decent movie. The one thing that annoyed me though, apart from the dumbass General, was Rose\u2019s powers always shorting out at critical moments, even after she had supposedly overcome the interference of the \u201cqueen\u201d."

        "In 2009 is geoloog Adrian Helmsley op bezoek in India bij een collega en krijgt te horen dat door een grote zonnevlam neutrino's tegenwoordig microgolven afgeven. Daardoor warmt de kern van de aarde met grote snelheid op wat zal leiden tot rampzalige gevolgen voor de planeet. Adrian haast zich terug naar de Verenigde Staten en waarschuwt Anheuser, stafchef van het Witte Huis, die op zijn beurt de president inlicht. Adrian maakt vanaf dan deel uit van de staf van de president en wordt gevraagd een schema te maken van de mogelijke gebeurtenissen die zullen plaatsvinden in de komende jaren.\r\nIn 2012 blijkt dat de president opdracht heeft gegeven om 8 grote arken te bouwen waarin 800.000 mensen op basis van DNA, expertise en wetenschap zich schuil zouden kunnen houden. Inmiddels weten ook alle leiders van de meeste landen in de wereld van dit plan af en worden er selecties gemaakt. Ondertussen komt Jackson Curtis in Los Angeles zijn kinderen ophalen bij zijn ex-vrouw Kate (die samenwoont met haar vriend Gordon). Hij neemt z'n kinderen mee naar Yellowstone National Park. Daar worden ze vervolgens meegenomen door het leger en ontmoeten Adrian, die hen de smoes voorlegt dat Yellowstone in moeilijkheden verkeert en daarom geen toeristen toestaat. Ook ontmoeten ze Charlie Frost, die een eigen radiozender heeft en Jackson vertelt dat de wereld binnenkort vergaat. Hij zegt erbij dat er een grote groep mensen is die plaats mag nemen in \"ruimteschepen\" waar hij de locatie van weet. Jackson brengt op verzoek van zijn ex-vrouw zijn kinderen terug naar L.A., alwaar hij hoort dat er een aardbeving heeft plaatsgevonden die een grote scheur in de aarde heeft veroorzaakt. In het Witte Huis wordt duidelijk dat het schema van Adrian sneller verloopt dan ze dachten, en dat door de grote hitte van de aardkern de mantel ook vloeibaarder is geworden, waardoor de aardkorst als het ware \"los\" kan drijven, en dus zal gaan verschuiven. Ook krijgen ze te horen dat er maar 4 arken op tijd klaar zullen zijn. Jackson wordt opgeroepen als chauffeur om de zoons van de Russische miljardair Yuri Karpov op te halen en ze naar het vliegveld te brengen. Hier laat \u00e9\u00e9n van de zoons per ongeluk los dat zij de rampen zullen overleven en Jackson niet. Met de informatie die Jackson al van Charlie kreeg, realiseert hij zich dat er inderdaad rampzalige dingen zullen gaan gebeuren, en hij rijdt terug naar L.A. om z'n familie op te halen. Hij gebruikt een vliegtuig en Gordon, die amateurpiloot is, is uiteindelijk gedwongen het vliegtuig te besturen wanneer hun piloot blijkt te zijn omgekomen. Terwijl ze opstijgen is de familie Curtis getuige van de complete verwoesting van Los Angeles. De stad verdwijnt door de aardkorstverschuiving volledig in de Stille Oceaan.\r\nIn het Witte Huis wordt Adrian verteld dat de aardkorstverschuiving voor honderden aardbevingen heeft gezorgd en al 2 miljoen slachtoffers heeft ge\u00ebist. President Wilson geeft het bevel dat zijn personeel zo snel mogelijk het vliegtuig in moet om naar China te vertrekken, waar de ruimteschepen liggen. Hij onthult ook aan Adrian dat hij zelf niet mee zal gaan, omdat iemand de rest van de wereld op de hoogte zal moeten brengen van de komende rampen die tot het einde van de wereld zullen leiden. De president vindt dat hijzelf daar de aangewezen persoon voor is. Adrian gaat vervolgens met Anheuser en andere personeelsleden aan boord van een Air Force One. Jackson beseft intussen dat als ze het willen overleven, ze de locatie van de schepen moeten zien te achterhalen. Hij overtuigt Gordon er daarom van om naar Yellowstone te vliegen en Charlie te vinden, om zo de locatie van de \"ruimteschepen\" te achterhalen. Terwijl Gordon het vliegtuig bijvult met brandstof, gaat Jackson op zoek naar Charlie en vindt hem. Hij vertelt dat de kaart in zijn camper ligt. Jackson weet net op tijd weg te komen als de vulkaan onder Yellowstone plotseling uitbarst. De familie ontsnapt met het vliegtuig net op tijd aan de aswolken. Jackson ontdekt op de kaart dat ze naar China moeten en ze landen uiteindelijk in Las Vegas om nieuwe brandstof te tanken. Hier lopen ze Yuri en z'n gezin tegen het lijf. Hun vliegtuig is gecrasht. Yuri's piloot Sascha neemt vervolgens een oude Antonov An-225 over, maar heeft een co-piloot nodig, waardoor de familie Curtis en Gordon mee kunnen. Ze willen landen in Hawa\u00ef om meer brandstof te tanken, maar ontdekken dat Hawa\u00ef volledig is veranderd in een vulkanisch gebied. Ze zijn gedwongen verder te vliegen. Sascha voorspelt dat ze binnen 15 minuten in de Stille Oceaan zullen neerstorten. Wanneer hij door de wolken heen is, ziet hij dat waar de oceaan zou moeten zijn, een grote ijsmassa te vinden is. Jackson realiseert zich dat de aardkorstverschuivingstheorie werkelijk bestaat. Ze storten neer op een gletsjer waarbij Sascha omkomt. Vervolgens worden ze gevonden door Chinese troepen, die bezig zijn dieren over te brengen naar de schepen. De soldaten nemen Yuri en z'n kinderen mee wanneer hij zijn tickets laat zien. Daardoor blijven de familie Curtis, Gordon en Yuri's vriendin Tamara (die geen ticket had) achter. In China, bij de schepen, wordt duidelijk dat van \u00e9\u00e9n van de arken het dak is ingestort door de aardkorstverschuiving en wordt het Laura en Adrian duidelijk dat de passagiers helemaal niet op basis van DNA en wetenschap zijn gekozen, maar dat rijke mensen hun toegang hebben kunnen kopen: zij hebben per ticket 1 miljard euro neergeteld. Adrian wordt vervolgens door zijn Indiase collega opgebeld met de mededeling dat India op het punt staat overspoeld te worden door een gigantische tsunami. Hierdoor beseft Adrian dat de tsunami hen eerder zal bereiken dan gepland, en dat ze op moeten schieten. Wanneer Anheuser dit hoort, maakt hij de beslissing de poorten van de schepen eerder te sluiten, waardoor tienduizenden mensen, onder wie Yuri en zijn zoons, buitengesloten worden.\r\nJackson en z'n familie worden intussen opgepikt door een Tibetaanse monnik die op weg is naar de schepen om aan boord te gaan. Ze worden door diens broer aan boord gesmokkeld van een ark via de machinekamer en Jackson beseft dat de schepen geen ruimteschepen maar arken zijn. Ze komen vast te zitten wanneer de poorten weer zakken op bevel van Adrian, die de buitengesloten mensen toch wil binnenlaten. Gordon wordt tussen de tandwielen geslingerd en overlijdt, en tegelijk komt ook een drilboor vast te zitten tussen de motoren, waardoor de poort niet meer volledig kan sluiten. Yuri weet z'n kinderen net op tijd aan boord te krijgen, maar valt vervolgens zelf van het platform en sterft. Nu de poort niet meer volledig sluit, kan de bemanning de motoren niet starten. De tsunami komt al snel hun kant op en water begint de ark binnen te stromen, waarna de passagiers benedendeks door het water waden. Jackson en z'n gezin worden gesplitst doordat waterbestendige deuren sluiten. Daardoor komen zij in verschillende compartimenten terecht. Adrian ziet via de camera's dat Jackson aan boord is weten te komen en haast zich naar de compartimenten om hem en zijn familie te redden. Tamara, die alleen zit, verdrinkt al snel wanneer het water te hoog komt. Jackson hoort van Adrian dat de compartimenten alleen maar open kunnen gaan wanneer de boor uit de motoren wordt gehaald en het hele systeem weer werkt. Met hulp van z'n zoontje Noah weet Jackson dit voor elkaar te krijgen. De poort sluit weer zodat de motoren kunnen worden gestart en een botsing met de Mount Everest ternauwernood wordt voorkomen. Jackson en z'n familie maar ook de monniken worden bevrijd, en Jackson en Kate herenigen zich.\r\n27 dagen later (datum: \"27ste dag van de eerste maand, jaar 0001\") krijgen de arken de eerste satellietfoto binnen, waaruit duidelijk wordt dat Afrika het enige continent is dat niet volledig is overstroomd. Het ligt nu zelfs hoger, waardoor de Drakensbergen nu de hoogste bergen ter wereld zijn. Uit metingen wordt duidelijk dat de lucht weer enigszins schoon is en dat de poorten van de arken kunnen worden geopend. Daardoor kan de mensheid voor het eerst sinds de overstroming weer naar buiten.",
        "And the public gets what the public wants.\r\n\r\nRoland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.\r\n\r\nThe carnage effects are grade \"A\" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.\r\n\r\n2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10"

        "I actually enjoyed the movie so much that i'll recommend it to all my friends, at first i didn't really want to watch it because i'm not into super hero movies at all, but i did anyway, i mean people were talking so much about it i had to see it myself and what an awesome choice i made. The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again. Thank you for taking the time read my review and if you're asking yourself if you should watch this movie, it's a definite Yes.",
        "> So this guy in the red suit came and broke some records...\r\n\r\nI was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.\r\n\r\nThis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10",
        "Though I have always been a DC enthusiast, I was intrigued by the idea of the Deadpool movie, and knew I'd end up watching it (I probably see 70% of DC films that are released and maybe 20% of Marvel ones). I enjoyed its definitely postmodern approach--and wish Reynolds' Green Lantern movie had one-tenth the humour and charm that THIS film had.\r\n\r\nIt'll be very interesting to see how comic-book movies are affected, both short- and long-term by its massive success.",
        "This film was very funny. Ryan Reynolds was made for this role. The innuendos did get a bit much though.\r\n\r\nIt was well written and the direction was very good but it did go into a territory that it was trying to make fun of. I got bored of all the action hero conventions after a while.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd",
        "As a comic book fan, I was fairly dubious about Deadpool\u2019s cinematic outing. I wasn't altogether sure that a film that would obviously have to be fun, self-referential and self-aware could also be able to talk about a character who not only becomes seriously ill, but also struggles to keep a grip on his sanity well enough to do the character justice. \r\n\r\nWhen I watched the film, it was clear that I had been over-thinking. Perhaps the makers of the film had thought the same as me. Perhaps they thought that trying to be lighthearted and slightly dark at the same time would be like trying to keep too many balls in the air. I say that because the issue of Deadpool\u2019s sanity, or lack thereof, is only touched upon. If that is the case, I think it is quite a clever decision in a \u2018let's not try to run before we can walk\u2019 kind of a way. If not, Tim Miller has still given us a very enjoyable film, in which, Ryan Reynolds shines as an extremely good comedic actor.",
        "After what I honestly think is the best promotional & viral marketing campaign a film has had, probably ever, the Deadpool feature film is finally here! And it's... Alright.\r\n\r\nI always try to manage expectations with these things, but after the aforementioned advertisements as well as multiple critics I highly regard the opinions of raving about it (John Campea of Collider for example gave the film his seventh 5-out-of-5 in his entire career) and my well-documented appreciation for the character of Deadpool, not to mention it's higher MPAA rating, there's only so neutral you can be going in. Still, I don't think my own personal biases had me too overhyped for Deadpool, I think I can fairly lay the lion's share of my underwhelming experience at the film itself.\r\n\r\nI should start out by saying that I didn't dislike Deadpool, I'm giving it a positive rating, and I recommend that people go watch it. Three stars for me is not a low score at all, I am glad I watched the movie and would happily watch it again, this is not a scathing review; Ryan Reynolds has tried his hand at the comic book film no less than five times, and of those five movies, Deadpool is inarguably the best.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that among those other four films, Ryan Reynolds was not the problem in them, but they were all truly bad movies.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Deadpool is done is pretty impressive, we get all the gore-laden action, R-rated comedy, quip-havery and fourth-wall-breaking you could want from a feature of his own. There are lots of meta-references to previous work to the past failings of both Reynolds as well as the Fox Studio itself. It's non-linear. It's 100% non-serious, almost a comedy before an action film. It's like the 22 Jump Street of the superhero genre. Stylistically, it's a completely fresh comic book movie.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the complete juxtaposition of how unbelievably generic the actual plot is, is so jarring. It's not only completely unoriginal, it's sometimes downright bland. The \"how\" is great, but the core of the \"what\" feels completely uninspired, and these two aspects clash up against each other very unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nPoints go out to the work done between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, although the majority of their characters' relationship is montaged through, the actors themselves had a great on-screen chemistry. I'm also totally on board for a Deadpool sequel (which has been greenlit) or seeing Deadpool show up in other X-franchise properties. But that doesn't mean I can give Deadpool a pass on the things that didn't gel for me.\r\n\r\n63% \r\n\r\n-Gimly"

        "As there was not much more to be told from the end of the previous movie, just assist to more than 2h of continuous battle.\r\n\r\nQuite pointless, but you may enjoy the action if that is what you were looking for ...",
        "The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien\u2019s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a \u201cTolkienesque\u201d athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",
        "Comparing the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy and the _Hobbit_ trilogy was already like comparing apples and mediocre oranges, but none so mediocre as _Battle of the Five Armies_. Don't get me wrong, I love a \"battle\" as much as the next guy, more maybe, I don't even mind a movie that's 95% battle, but in this? It does. Not. Work.\r\n\r\n_Five Armies_ is a movie that never made it out of pre-viz, let alone to a polished, well-rounded, final cut. I enjoy it to some degree when running through a Middle-Earth marathon as a whole, but only when the group I'm with will let me roll my eyes and complain about it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
        "Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end <em>'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'</em> definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else.\r\n\r\nNone of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Hobbit'</em> series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it. Happy to have watched them though, I'd still recommend them for sure."

        "By this point in the franchise, \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 fans will know exactly what to expect from \u2018Hobbs and Shaw\u2019, and there\u2019s just enough here that's fresh enough to warrant taking another ride with the series.\r\n- Ashley Teresa\r\n\r\nRead Ashley's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-fast-and-furious-hobbs-and-shaw-very-furious-not-so-fast",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing about the Fast & Furious franchise: it can be dumb fun. Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic\u2026 As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can\u2019t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn\u2019t and take everything seriously. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that\u2019s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it\u2019s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they\u2019re getting themselves into. However, it didn\u2019t quite work for me this time\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There\u2019s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It\u2019s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it\u2019s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that\u2019s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn\u2019t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn\u2019t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson\u2019s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there\u2019s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the \u201csuperhero\u201d vibe Elba should have. That\u2019s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your \u201cheroes\u201d are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your \u201csuperpowered villain\u201d different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a \u201cblack Superman\u201d has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It\u2019s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It\u2019s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn\u2019t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it\u2019s going to end, but then there\u2019s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won\u2019t spoil, but \u2026 It\u2019s not like it\u2019s forced because it actually isn\u2019t. It follows a logical path, characters don\u2019t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There\u2019s even a line similar to \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we\u2019re still alive\u201d, but they never go there again. It\u2019s like it never happened\u2026 Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That\u2019s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I\u2019m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they\u2019re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won\u2019t believe who\u2019s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn\u2019t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn\u2019t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast\u2019s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven\u2019t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film. You\u2019ve been warned.\r\n\r\nRating: C",
        "I generally really enjoy the Fast and Furious movies and was looking forward to this spin-off, especially being directed by David Leitch, but nothing in this stood out action/stunts-wise and the chemistry between Johnson/Statham/Kirby was lackluster, including the quasi-budding romance with Johnson and Kirby. A lot of this film felt forced and going in the science fiction realm just felt wrong. Sure, it's got the dumb elements F&F is known for, but very little of this was fun. **2.75/5**",
        "Yeah, sure, fuck it, why not, hey? I mean the _Fast & Furious_ franchise was already dipping into some sci-fi elements, why not just whole-hog dive into it for your spinoff? Dumb as dogshit, but might genuinely be the best thing _Fast & Furious_ has ever produced. Has cars in it, but stops bothering to try and pretend racing them is actually important to the story. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
        "Wow! That was just fucking awesome!\r\n\r\nDon't know why there's so many haters though. Hobbs and Shaw was the best action movie in 2019.\r\n\r\nYeah, it was cheesy. Very cheesy. But in an awesome way."

        "The Wolf of Wall Street is so addicting to watch, that even with it's 3 hour long run time, you wont be surprised if you end up watching it four days in a row. <br>\r\n     This is Scorsese letting loose and having fun, showing all of the debauchery (and man, is there a lot) in all of it's glory. There are orgies, sex, nudity, copious amounts of drug use, and it now holds the record for the most use of fuck in any film. <br>\r\n     Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering and hilarious performance as Jordan Belfort. He throws himself into the role with free abandon, while also showing that he's aces when it comes to comic timing and physical comedy. If he doesn't win an Oscar this season I'll be quite upset, though Matt from Dallas Buyers Club rightfully deserves it as well. But this is a 3 hour long film, and Leo is in every single second of every single scene. He's ferocious, hilarious, out of his mind, and flat out brilliant.<br>\r\n     The supporting players are tops as well. I was somewhat baffled when Jonah Hill earned a nominee for Moneyball, but this time around he rightfully deserves this years nominations. With his pearly white teeth, charisma, while also throwing himself into the role with no fear, this is without a doubt his greatest work as an actor to date. The real find, however, is Margot Robbie. Strikingly beautiful, her character could have been one note, but she also hits the ball out of the court. Even Matthew Macconaughey steals the show with only one scene. <br>\r\n     Dangerously funny, superbly edited, and with a delicious, irreverent, savage bite. The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his wildest. And it goes without saying, that this is one of the best films of last year. Just stay away if you are in any way a prude or conservative. \r\n     Rated R- Graphic nudity, strong sexual content, drug use throughout, pervasive language, and some violence.",
        "An excessive movie in all possible senses with breath taking Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill which is not long in spite of its 3h length but which ends not knowing exactly which is the point of the story.",
        "**Voracious Bull**\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to enjoy a Martin Scorcese movie post-1980 I ask myself what made _Raging Bull_ so great? Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after _Apocalypse Now_? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw _Raging Bull_ in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top _Pulp Fiction_. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up _Citizen Kane_. \r\n\r\nAfter _Raging Bull_, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, _Goodfellas_ is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\r\n\r\n_The Wolf of Wall Street_ is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute.",
        "I didn't care for the characters, but I damn did have a great time watching <em>'The Wolf of Wall Street'</em>. It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love <em>(fwiw: all 9/10+)</em> them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.\r\n\r\nJonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, <em>'Moneyball'</em>. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.\r\n\r\nThe almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment.",
        "When I'm Scorsese's age I just hope to still be able to chew my food and go to the bathroom unassisted. That he can still make some of the most cutting edge, visceral, and enjoyable films out there is stunning. \r\n\r\nIs this his best film? No. But, even a mediocre film for him is better than 99% of the movies being made. \r\n\r\nThe performances are super-fun, the pace is relentless, the visual flare is incredible, and the story is fascinating. Is there a discussion to be had about the immorality being glamorized by this film? Sure. That's the case for a lot of his films (and a lot of films in general). We could debate his intentions with the outcome and what the film is saying about our society all day but that's another discussion. Is the film a joy to watch? Yes! It definitely is."

        "I fully understand that Christopher Nolan is trying to play with time, as that what's the movie's about - and yes, he is known for confusing movies - but here, Nolan has made something uninteresting. The idea of things going backwards is cool, but the rules are unclear. We never know what the basic goal is - I could understand secrets, but the film has to be interesting and 'Tenet' simply isn't. Nothing here makes me want to work things out; it's forgettable. Sure, you can say this has to be seen on the big screen, but the long runtime makes it unappealing to most mainstream audiences. Unfortunately, 'Tenet' is not here to save the 2020 box office. I work at a cinema, and to say it underperformed well would be correct. We are going to see more 'Tenet' hot-take YouTube videos than thinkpiece/what you missed ones. Christopher Nolan has made his most forgettable film to date - it's not a bad movie and I'm sure his diehard fans will adore this one, but for everyone else, there isn't much here. 'Tenet' won't be remembered as another \u201cgroundbreaking visual spectacle\u201c from Nolan or for \u201csaving cinema\u201c. It will be remembered for its weird release schedule and having been shown during a global pandemic, and that's unfortunate. Like the rest of the year, 'Tenet' is a write-off.\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-tenet-time-runs-up-like-my-enjoyment-of-nolans-latest-film",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I've yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called \"cinematic experience\", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.\r\n\r\nNowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the \"savior of cinema\" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, \"savior of cinema\" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.\r\n\r\nI'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.\r\n\r\nNolan said that Tenet would be \"the hardest movie to cut\" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.\r\n\r\nFinally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.\r\n\r\nStory-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.\r\n\r\nThe need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.\r\n\r\nThis last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled \"Action!\", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled \"Cut!\". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.\r\n\r\nHowever, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the \"humorless\" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called \"blockbuster of the summer\" that everyone deserves this year.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the \"savior of cinema\" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
        "There is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. Up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark Nolan, but the central hook of the film - \u201ctime inversion\u201d - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. But then comes the \u201cmoment\u201d - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. It\u2019s the kind of twist that isn\u2019t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. Nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this \u201cmoment\u201d for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. This means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.\r\n\r\nPerformances are great, with Branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably Zimmeresque and loud. It doesn\u2019t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - Inception - but it\u2019s scope is similarly impressive and it\u2019s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character\u2019s journey through the film. Great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while.",
        "I was recently asked if this was better or worse than Inception. \r\n Personally, I don\u2019t think you can compare any of his films outside the fact that he made them. Like those made by Tarantino, each film is its own living masterpiece ... \r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Nolan, this is a must see!",

More precisely, the laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations (or symmetries) known as C, P, and T (C means changing particles for antiparticles. P means taking the mirror image, so left and right are interchanged. And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles: in effect, running the motion backward). The laws of science that govern the behaviour of matter under all normal situations are unchanged under the combination of the two operations C and P on their own. In other words, life would be just the same for the inhabitants of another planet who were both mirror images of us and who were made of antimatter, rather than matter._\r\n\r\n>_If the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P, and also by the combination C, P, and T, they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone. Yet there is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behaviour is never observed in ordinary life._\r\n\r\n>_The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system, disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round._\r\n\r\n- Stephen Hawking; _A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes_ (1988)\r\n\r\n> _Imagine you and a friend decide to go to Pisa, with one of you standing atop the famous leaning tower and the other located down at the bottom.

Time reversal can be thought of the same way as motion reversal: if the rules are the same whether you run the clock forwards or backwards, there's true T-symmetry.

And it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that Nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. More so than any of his previous work, _Tenet_ is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. Now, don't get me wrong, I love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are Terrence Malick and David Lynch), but _Tenet_ isn't an especially experimental film \u2013 it's a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSpending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. It's a theme that's front and centre in _Memento_ (2000), _Inception_ (2010), _Interstellar_ (2014), and _Dunkirk_ (2017), and to a lesser extent in _Following_ (1998) and _The Prestige_ (2006) (I haven't seen any of his _Dark Knight_ trilogy so I can't attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of _Insomnia_). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time's arrow, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). Indeed, one of the film's central questions is especially noteworthy \u2013 if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven't happened to us yet also speak to our identity? Do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? It's a fascinating question. And one with which Nolan does precisely nothing. However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.\r\n\r\nThe premise of _Tenet_ is straightforward in outline. The film opens as a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the Kiev Opera House. He finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible \u2013 a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is \"un-shot\", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. The Protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. Rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as Tenet. His mission is fairly simply \u2013 at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. Along the way, he makes the acquaintance of Neil (Robert Pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; Andrei Sator (a spectacularly miscast Kenneth Branagh giving new meaning to clich\u00e9d villainy), a dangerous Russian oligarch; Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), Andrei's oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; Priya (Dimple Kapadia), an arms dealer; Ives (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Tenet soldier; Michael Crosby (Michael Caine), a British intelligence bigwig; and Barbara (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.\r\n\r\n_Tenet_ is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this. The budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, \"they must have spent a lot on catering.\" With _Tenet_, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) \u2013 whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. Even Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.\r\n\r\nAs cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), I've never quite seen anything like it. It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, \"how the hell did they do that?\"; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. Along the same lines, the cinematography by the great Hoyte van Hoytema (_The Fighter_; _Spectre_; _Ad Astra_) is stunning, with van Hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm IMAX film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although I saw it on an IMAX screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema \u2013 no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and I admire that a great deal. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and _Tenet_ finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don't, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems \u2013 most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a clich\u00e9, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times. The idea of saving all mankind simply doesn't pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to those characters. Good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cipher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. But there's nothing more to him \u2013 he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. I'm not a huge fan of Washington in general, who I feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but I am a huge fan of Branagh, and he's even worse. Think of the most clich\u00e9d Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person \u2013 he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clich\u00e9s, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was \"that accent is hilarious.\" Pattinson's Neil and Debicki's Kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they're gears in the machinery of Nolan's plot.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is _obliged_ to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in _Tenet_, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.\r\n\r\nAt one point early in the film, Barbara tells The Protagonist, \"_don't try to understand it, just feel it_\", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. _Tenet_ is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike _Memento_ (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, _Tenet_ offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's a twist towards the end that I literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void \u2013 all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.",
        "I believe Tenet is very underrated. This movie is just too good! The soundtrack, the action, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, and the fact that CGI wasn't really involved much! \r\n\r\nYet it was indeed challenging to understand. However, after watching Dark, I didn't face much difficulty in understanding the plot, as both have a lot in common.  \r\n\r\nNolan's movies aren't there to satisfy you, they are more of something to be felt. I loved Tenet as much as I loved his other movies...",
        "Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's films but this one didn't quite do it for me. One, confusing story that was hard to follow at times (I got the gist), but beyond that, wasn't terribly entertained. Acting was shaky, Pattison was fine but really disappointed with John David Washington, though he's not helped by cliched dialogue. IDK, didn't hate it at all and maybe will revisit it one day, but this is easily Nolan's weakest film to date. **3.0/5**",
        "I\u2019m a bit annoyed I couldn\u2019t understand the first twenty minutes because of the bombastic bass and a bit underwhelmed by the lack of an emotional arc, but all things considered, Tenet is an epic, mind-blowing James Bond film masquerading as a Christopher Nolan film.\u00a0",
        "Nolan's latest movie is one of his worst. An exaggerated film whose only purpose is to complicate the viewer, but I wish he could do it with cinema. These ambiguities are created only by the chaotic and crowded montage and a series of theoretical dialogues, and no cinema is seen in it. Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created. Aside from the fact that the film does not even come close to form, it is also very beginner in terms of technique, excessive cuts, and sometimes weird and inappropriate! The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible. In general, the film is considered to be a very bad and weak film, which is like a puzzle without a pattern, meaning that after putting the white pieces together, which is not a difficult task, it has nothing to offer.",

        "It was a long time since I watched a new blockbuster movie and, mostly for personal reasons, even longer since I actually reviewed a movie, blockbuster or not.\r\n\r\nI guess this movie is not the most simple one to pick to get my reviews/blogging back on track but there\u2019s not that much new movies to chose from this year with the pandemic and all.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I approached this movie with some hesitation and perhaps with an assumption that I wouldn\u2019t like it since I have an aversion towards time travel in movies and books. It is more often than not that the author gets it more or less spectacularly wrong and it turns into a mess.\r\n\r\nWell, I have to say that, in my mind, this movie was a bit of a mess. I felt confused and found it difficult to follow the various twists more than once. Also, at least in the beginning, the parts about bullets jumping up in your hand instead of falling out because the bullets where travelling backwards in time sounded somewhat unbelievable to me. I can accept something travelling backwards in time but for such a bullet to jump up into someone\u2019s hand, seemingly on command, no I do not think that\u2019s very believable at all.\r\n\r\nOnce I had watched the entire movie to the end, then finally, some of the first parts started to make sense. Personally I don\u2019t like that I spend a large part of the movie wondering what the f\u2026 even if it (mostly) becomes clear towards the end.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say, it was a quite cool mess.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I quite like the main protagonist. Whether he\u2019s traveling forwards or backwards he kicks ass and he\u2019s intelligent. He is very much a James Bond type of character which I like.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a shitload of action in this movie and it is both well done as well as cool. Of course, with the budget this movie had I would really be disappointed if there wasn\u2019t good special effects in it. However, one thing that made the effects and action to stand out in this movie compared was this concept that for some people, and objects as well, time moved backwards. Watching some of the larger scenes where some explosions where actually explosions and some where implosions. Cars moving both forwards and backwards in car chases etc. etc. I have opinions about the plausibility of that but it looked cool at least.\r\n\r\nFor me the enjoyment of this movie was the main protagonist which I liked and the cool action. The story itself and its rather convoluted (but original I have to say that) time travel concept, well I\u2019m not sure I was (am) too trilled about that except for the fact that it allowed these rather original special effects.",
        "Appreciated this film more than any Nolan film since The Dark Knight. Usually his films aim for high concept but get weighed down by syrupy schmaltz. This one ditches his unconvincing attempts at emotional/philosophical depth and just focuses on the very creative core concept of inverted time. There's no labored soliloquies about the power of love, no epic aspirations of cultural poignancy - it's mainly just a bunch of exposition interspersed between some truly breathtaking visual and audio spectacle like nothing else. \r\n\r\nNolan is an artist first and foremost. His films always have a level of craft that is beyond comprehension for mere mortals like me. And in this one he turns that up to eleven. Honestly, I actually enjoyed the challenging sound design. It reminded me of the film Primer (another time bending mind melter) where the discussions about complicated ideas are drowned out by background noise and music because he knows we won't understand and it's not important anyway. What is important is that we \"feel it\" (as is literally said). \r\n\r\nDon't try to figure it out. Just enjoy that an arthouse abstractionist who somehow gets 100+ million dollar budgets to make quirky stories with set pieces that will blow your mind."

        "It was okay. Glad it wasn't just a rehash of the original (which I have a little fondness for, as many issues that one had). This one seemed to have elements of The Witch to me and at least found it mildly entertaining and I liked Charlotte Vega in the lead. However, found the six main characters to be just dumb asses, but maybe that's the most realistic element, I can see 20-somethings going off-trail like that. Anyway, doubtful I'll ever watch (anytime soon) but probably worth a rental. **3.0/5**",
        "I've long said that if you're going to bother remaking a film, it either needs to be a genuine continuation of the original, or a reboot, that offers a different spin on the same basic concepts. This film certainly falls into the latter category, but that's about the only thing it does right. Everything else, from writing to acting is an unbelievably cringey misfire, that manages to offend and belittle every demographic, in nearly equal doses. This isn't a film for right-wingers, and though it tries to be, it's not one for the left either. It's simply a catastrophic mess, that takes one of the most basic premises in horror history, and tries to use it for social commentary. I'm all well and good with politics in my cinema, even horror, and I'm a very left-leaning individual, but there's a way to imbue progressive values in a film, and a way not to. This is a masterclass on how not to.\r\n\r\nThe basics for a decent horror flick were here. At it's core, the film's bones are still very much structured after the backwoods horror that inspired the original \"Wrong Turn\". Where this film differs is in it's treatment of the hillbillies themselves. There's no slobbering, deformed monster-men here. Instead, we're given a cult-like group, with a very nomadic culture. Supposedly the ancestors of a group that headed into the mountains during the Civil War, and intended to create a free, equal society based on primitivism. The film's horror elements are decent, especially the variety of deadly hunting traps littering the forest for wayward travelers to stumble into. These moments provide some memorable, sometimes shocking set-pieces, but that's the only positive beyond decent enough direction.\r\n\r\nWhere the film goes wrong is in it's socio-political tones. Backwoods horror has long commented on the disparity between rural peoples and so-called \"city slickers\", but this film is overbearing in the heavy-handedness it uses to drive home this point, with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. The main characters are a group of clich\u00e9s, each meant to tick off a minority status. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying that from a reactionary point of view, the characterizations are simply insulting and the dialogue sounds as if it was written by a bratty child. The characters are needlessly and viciously antagonistic to the rural peoples, before they even get on the mountain. Once they do reach the mountain, the film's \"clever twist\" becomes quickly apparent. Not long after the group begins wandering into the traps, it becomes apparent that the mountain dwellers are not trying to kill them. These kids are simply setting off hunting traps by being off the beaten path, but when they see the fiercely dressed cultists, speaking tongues, they assume they are in danger and thus attack. This is the film's un-subtle commentary on society's tendency to misunderstand other cultures and pre-judge based on appearance.\r\n\r\nAll would be well and good, except that the cult themselves are no better than these bougie, ignorant city kids. They deal out their own twisted brand of \"an eye for an eye\" justice, and turn out to be nothing more than a hyper-traditionalist group of rapists, that may not be as benign as the film paints them in the middle segment. Still, there's hardly anyone to root for. It quickly becomes apparent that the cult are nothing but barbaric heathens, but the kids make so many poor choices and intentionally provoke violence instead of being mature adults. The film unironically could have ended well for everyone if certain characters had kept their mouths shut, but this is one of those scripts in which the entire plot hinges on everyone being as vapid as possible. In the end, despite it's pretensions to say something progressive, it ends up painting both left, right and everything in between as idiocy. Couple this with dialogue so poor that it evokes laughter, and this is a bizarre effort that I can't believe ever saw wide release. We can only hope this train-wreck doesn't somehow inspire a slew of increasingly lousy sequels as the original film did. Because this one already set the bar as low as possible.",
        "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis has very little to do with the original other than weird people hunting people in the woods.\r\n\r\nThis movie surprised me quite a bit, I just didn't expect it to take the story form that it did.  The cast all did a great job, and the story is well written in layers.\r\n\r\nThe movie also does something I've noticed some movies have been doing somewhat recently where the movie ends, but continues with what feels like a new story, related to the first.  Other movies have done this (though much more sloppily) in the past, but I feel like writers have started to do this on purpose, to very good effect.\r\n\r\nThe movie is good at keeping the audience in the dark to what is going on, and being brutal with the characters in rather interesting ways.\r\n\r\nIf you like slasher / horror at all, definitely give this a watch."

        "Out of all the films nominated for best picture, there is one that isn\u2019t getting much attention at all. In Hacksaw Ridge, the narrative surrounding the film doesn\u2019t have much to do the film at all because it\u2019s identity seems to be centered on Mel Gibson\u2019s comeback.\r\n\r\nRead More: https://reviews.boxofficebuz.com/review/hacksaw-ridge",
        "I first saw Hacksaw Ridge, back in November when it first came out.. Went to an afternoon screening and it was packed. From the very first scene to the last , I was in awe. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",
        "**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",
        "Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe. \r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",
        "***Tribute to a real-life WW2 \u201cconscientious collaborator\u201d*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss\u2019 potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn\u2019t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one\u2019s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren\u2019t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple \u2013 throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They\u2019re wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-"

        "Disparate bunch of tough-guy types plucked from various dumb action sub-genres (a black-ops mercenary, a Spetsnaz operative, a drug cartel goon, a yakuza, a killer, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker), all of whom get an opportunity to do their \"thang\" at some point during the movie, get picked off one by one in typical fashion, in a setting designed to evoke the 1987 original's jungle shenanigans. Meh. Can't say that I entirely buy into Adrian Brody as an action hero lead, either. Arguably the worst leading tough-guy since Danny Glover in, um, Predator 2.\r\n\r\nSomething else bugged me about it, too. It's a petty quibble, but it irked me nonetheless:\r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\r\n\r\nDid you ever see the trailer for Predators? At the 1.23 mark is IMO the most effective shot in the trailer: Brody's character has one of those iconic triangulated laser sights (from the predators' shoulder-mounted guns) pointed at him. It moves up his body to his head. As it does, many more sights appear, all over him. More than a dozen. He has about fifteen predators all training their guns on him. How's he going to get out of that? He's fooked. Well, no, he's not, because that scene DOESN'T HAPPEN in the film. The first laser sight happens, yes, from the ONE predator of three (?) that are chasing them, but fifteen? No. All those other sights are added in just for the trailer, to make the film look more Predator-filled than it is.\r\n\r\nAs I said, a rather petty quibble, but it's one thing to edit the best bits of a movie together into a trailer to make it look more exiting than it maybe is over the course of two hours, and quite another to lie about what one can expect to see in said movie.",
        "They can hear you. Smell you. They see you. \r\n\r\nPredators is directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator. \r\n\r\nThe plot sees eight former members of Earth - mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted, it seems, for sport. \r\n\r\nIn 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse (though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster), reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel - with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However, it didn't happen and it's only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster. \r\n\r\nThe set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie, it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth, which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be. \r\n\r\nHowever, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberment's, beheadings and everyones personal fave - spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody. \r\n\r\nBrody is just fine, it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in action/adventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clich\u00e9s, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it first/next and etc. It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, he's also very miscast, but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either. \r\n\r\nNot great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder. A sequel would be welcome, but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel. 7/10"

I did think having a narrative to frame some of the 'pranks' was useful, though the story itself was far too contrived (perhaps purposefully?) to do anything but provide a respite between skits. Also, where's Hannibal Buress in this? Felt a bit weird to see him swapped for Lil Rel Howery, but perhaps it's related to his stepping away from _The Eric Andre Show_."

        "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nIf you are in a position to do so, then you could actually watch this movie before the \"Fear Street Part One 1994\".\r\n\r\nI think a large part of this is that Sadie Sink is an amazing actress and while she doesn't carry the movie, she outshines everyone else with whom she shares a screen.\r\n\r\nThis isn't even an origin story, but sort of meets all the pacing of one in a pretty excellent fashion.  Introducing Ziggy and the curse of the Sarah Fear all in one horrific go.\r\n\r\nThey do go a weirdly tasteful route where they previous showed high schoolers being killed, but do not show younger children being killed.  I honestly didn't expect it given the amount of blood and wounds are shown, but not really gore come to think of it, at least not in this one.\r\n\r\nEven as a stand alone movie, if you're into camp movies and like slashers, this is well worth the watch."

        "I like David Ayer. Based on interviews and his social media postings, seems like a cool guy. As a filmmaker, he's hit or miss ranging from some really solid action-thrillers like U-571, End of Watch and Fury to the poorly made flicks such as Sabotage (though has its moments) and Suicide Squad (which I've soured on over the years).\r\n\r\nHis latest, the second one straight-to-streaming following Bright, is The Tax Collector, seemingly aspiring to be some sort of modern day Godfather. The editing here is rather bad, acting was mixed with Shia LaBeouf shining brightest to the point I wish the movie was about his character while Bobby Soto has some okay scenes but in the lead, never quite works. And the writing, also by Ayer, was shoddy (shows Training Day was all about Washington's performance than the story or dialogue).\r\n\r\nI wanted to really like this film. It had potential and starts off well enough, but after meandering for the first hour or so, doesn't really get off the ground once a story actually kicks in. By the end, despite trying to have some emotional scenes, and a finale that was supposed to be kick ass, never could rebound from all of the other shortcomings. **2.5/5**"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nObviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show \u2026 He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur\u2019s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax \u2026 I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just\u2026 there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A",
        "Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, \u201c\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...\u201d. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.",
        "The Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius. The movie was a great depiction of how a person who has been mistreated, lied to, and ignored, totally lacking access to human compassion, can snap. The acting is top notch, and it puts a spotlight on the importance of mental health in modern times.",
        "Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I\u2019m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I\u2019ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cJoker\u201d is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur\u2019s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It\u2019s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We\u2019re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn\u2019t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur\u2019s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can\u2019t or won\u2019t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It\u2019s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.",
        "*A Masterpiece*.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows the escalating events that made Arthur become the Joker. Initially an inoffensive poor and sick man, Arthur suffered a tide of unfortunate events that pushed him closer and closer to the edge. \r\n\r\nIgnored and despised by everyone, sick and alone in the world, and neglected by the State, Arthur becomes progressively more violent until he breaks.\r\n\r\nMuch more than one more Super-hero movie, *Joker* uses well-known characters to promote the reflection on the \"ignored\" ones. At least, ignored until they become a Joker.",
        "***Not fun, but absorbing, artistic and tragic***\r\n\r\nA mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce\u2019s rich father.   \r\n\r\n\"Joker\" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics\u2019 villain, but it\u2019s more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie\u2019s captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience. \r\n\r\nThere are several amusing bits, but this ain\u2019t a fun flick. It\u2019s heavy and tragic. But what\u2019s the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He\u2019s a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber\u2019s \u201cNight of the Laughing Dead\u201d in Man-Thing #5 (1974).     \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).  \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/A",
        "_Joker_ is a tour-de-force of a movie, not quite like anything I've seen, maybe since Taxi Driver. At its core it's a movie about the breaking point of a broken man, wrapped under the banner of a comic book movie that, take out the Waynes, works on its own.\r\nJoaquin Phoenix truly gives a transformative performance (not unlike Heath Ledger) and will say is deserving of an Academy Award. The supporting cast all did well, though, and it is a small role, Zazie Beetz was great and De Niro had his moments, particularly at the end.\r\n\r\nGot to hand it to Todd Phillips, between this and the good, albeit flawed, War Dogs, has proven to be more than those Hangover movies.\r\n\r\nNo, this isn't a feel-good movie and while it does sit at the top of my 2019 list, not entirely sure when I'd revisit. **4.75/5**",
        "the \u2018Hangover 2 & 3\u2019, the two most uncomfortable comedies he\u2019s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There\u2019s also some dark humor in \u2018Joker\u2019 that involves a door chain. It\u2019s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there\u2019s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than \u201cguy gets shot in alleyway\u201d. He\u2019s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He\u2019s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it\u2019s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody\u2019s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone\u2019s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It\u2019s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it\u2019s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If \u201cJoker\u201d is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies \u20183 From Hell\u2019 should also receive the same attention. Just imagine \u2018Natural Born Killers\u2019 times 100, but I guess it\u2019s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there\u2019s some brutal and raw approach to violence in \u2018Joker\u2019, but we all have seen worst. \u2018Deadpool\u2019 is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: \u201cSend in the clowns\u201d \u21e0 you\u2019ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.",
        "It is intersting to analyze this movie in a context of global increase of violent social movements against the Establishment. Joker succeed in making me accept a violent reactions without really explicit political fundation.",
        "This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f\u2026 kidding me?\r\n\r\nThe only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cJoker\u201d in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it\u2019s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that\u2019s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called \u201ccritics\u201d on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy \u201creview\u201d site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.",
        "Joker made me laugh , cry , and made me feel scared . This movie isn't your run of the mill superhero flick this is a gritty  homage to that of films made by the great Martin Scorsese . Some scenes will have you in shock and awe without breaking away from what Arthur sees and feels as he lives in an 80's era Gotham living with <a href=\"https://paperhelp.nyc/\">paper help</a> and his mom and a mental disorder (Pseudobulbar affect if I'm not mistaken ) , the film also adds the unreliable narrator aspect ( where the camera can show you something that either isn't real or isn't happening), besides that the acting is phenomenal, Joaquin Phoenix really brings his A game, showing Arthur fleck as a loving, kind individual that just wants to make you laugh but is beaten down by an ever changing society that both beat him down and in the end breaks him. This movie also adds the idea of the \"one bad day\" theme from the killing joke comic where in the comic joker says and i quote '' all it takes is one bad day to bring the sanest man to lunacy \" and it takes that idea and brings it to the forefront. In conclusion I think joker was beyond amazing, between the acting, music score and set pieces it was a wild (and scary) ride . Symbolism also sneaks into the movie with slight things you wouldn't notice upon first watching . This movie leaves you confused on what was real and what wasn't . In the end between you and your spouse , friend , or family member will have reasons on what was real and what wasn't  and that's what made the movie even better for me , how it left me talking days after and like dark knight and iron man before this i believe that joker will change the superhero movie genre forever... send in the clowns 10/10 would see again",
        "Each to their own, as always, but for me: Incredible!\r\n\r\nI was fully aware of <em>'Joker'</em> ever since its release, impossible not to be given the extraordinary hype that surrounded it, but it still absolutely surpassed my expectations - a sensational film. I adored every second of this; and I'm not even a Joker/DC Comics etc. 'fan'.\r\n\r\nJoaquin Phoenix gives an astonishingly outstanding performance as the titular character, undoubtedly one of the greatest showings that I've ever seen from an actor. I'm not one that takes notice of awards, but he is fully deserving of anything of that ilk that he won due to this. Quality!\r\n\r\nEverything else about the film is fantastic. Great score, great cinematography, great pacing... it's all just utterly superb and makes for a spectacular watch. I love that they avoided just going wall-to-wall crazy with this, don't get me wrong things get mad but there's more to it than just violence et al.\r\n\r\nI had presumed that I was going to enjoy this, but it honestly smashed any predictions I had about it before seeing it. Even after just one viewing, I can already state it's one of my favourite films. Excellent!"

        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nBen Falcone and Melissa McCarthy, husband and wife, have been making movies together since the former began his filmmaking career. Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.\r\n\r\nDirectors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as \"remarkable cinema\". Something worthy of many Oscars, Golden Globes, and much more. Movies like Thunder Force aren't made to receive regular nominations, but instead, to try and be present at the Razzies - both Falcone and McCarthy have been quite successful in this achievement. While the actress continuously shows her undeniable talent that would be better employed in other films - such as Can You Ever Forgive Me? And Bridesmaids - the writer-director continues to put together awfully dull movies.\r\n\r\nTo be completely honest, the first act of Thunder Force is surprisingly decent. The setup to the main narrative is interesting enough, and the comedy peak is reached during the first half-hour. The massive problem is that this peak offers no more than a couple of chuckles occasionally. From the start of the second act until the very end, Falcone embarrassingly fails to offer genuine laughs. The tone is ridiculously out-of-balance, with almost every scene being a forced attempt at humor, even when the moment doesn't ask for it. Incredibly flat - and some disgusting - jokes are repeated throughout the film, which ends up dragging an already stretched out runtime.\r\n\r\nThe superhero plot is as generic and predictable as it could be in a movie that makes no effort in trying to do something remotely different than what viewers have seen for the last couple of decades. The VFX look like they came from an amateur studio as if Netflix didn't even care about its own product. Story-wise, there's not even a proper way of analyzing such a silly screenplay. In one moment, it seems to be taking a specific scene seriously, but a couple of minutes later, everything is back to the annoyingly dumb environment. Don't get me wrong: if there's a type of humor I absolutely adore is absurd comedy, but it needs to be done properly, with the right people and the right story.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I usually tend to have a light hand in films like this. Thunder Force is just another addition to the never-ending list of \"forgettable movies\", which isn't something that really bothers me. It's exactly what everyone expects it to be, which can work as a compliment if people want to. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is watching McCarthy and Octavia Spencer - two outstanding actresses with five Oscar nominations combined, including a win for the latter in The Help - working on hopeless projects such as this one. It begs the famous question: why?\r\n\r\nThunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story. A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.\r\n\r\nRating: D",

        "This movie was scheduled to release in early 2020 but due to the pandemic it was pushed back a year and I think due to its late release, there was just a lack of attention to mastering its release. Although this was considered a comedy, they producers attempted to create a somewhat heartfelt storyline that was just a complete miss. The most confusing issue I had with this movie was its target audience. Most \u201cjokes\u201d were for mature adults but the slapstick vibe the movie portrayed was just messy. Unfortunately, it appeared both main actresses just gave about 50% of their effort. This movie lacked personality, an entertainment factor, and a good storyline.",
        "This movie made me laugh at a time when I needed to laugh. Wgat\u2019s wrong with that?\r\n\r\nI think a lot of viewers, and not just paid critics who have to watch everything, started watching Thunder Force knowing they would hate it. Then they watched a few minutes of it and quickly slapped a low rating on it. I don\u2019t think it is a 10 star movie, or even close, but I rated it that way for the same reason some people gave it a 1: because I can - Nyah-Nyah. But seriously, I wanted to offered at least one of the throwaway one-star ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is not a serious superhero movie; it is not a plot-driven, thoughtful satire. It is a zany romp, a rollicking slice of slapstick. It is replete with physical humor, which is Melissa McCarthy\u2019s forte, our 21st century Lucille Ball channeling Harold Lloyd.\r\n\r\nFor the predominantly young men who totally trashed this, superheroing is serious business. Well, Marvel, DC universes, welcome to the Comedy Universe. We are sorry this film offends you, as we were regretful that My Spy offended the serious Bond or LeCarre fan - or maybe we aren\u2019t sorry.\r\n\r\nI just watched the preview again and laughed where I laughed the first time. \r\n\r\nLife can be grim and like I said, sometimes you need a laugh. Hmm, is this still on Netflix?"

        "'Fury' has fantastic set pieces. The special effects are incredible and the sound is brilliant. The film is very gory and there are lots of explosions and body parts flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nI could tell that the movie was trying to follow in the footsteps of 'Saving Private Ryan' by stealing a lot of the characters and trying to recreate the depth and heart of that film. However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.\r\n\r\n'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes. The film felt more like 'Tropic Thunder' than 'Saving Private Ryan'. \r\n\r\n'Fury''s lack of long shots of the landscapes and battles meant that the film did not seem as vast or beautiful as other films of the genre.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action scenes were very well done and it was exciting and superbly directed.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd",
        "I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.\n\nI can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.\n\nThe movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the \u201cheroes\u201d are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where \u201cWardaddy\u201d forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I\u2019ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.\n\nHaving said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.\n\nThe \u201clast stand\u201d at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our \u201cheroes\u201d have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f\u2026 did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.\n\nThe ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.",
        "WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014, \"Fury\" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. \r\n\r\nWriter/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent \"Training Day.\" In \"Fury\" he successfully shows the soldiers\u2019 view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970) perhaps comes closest.\r\n\r\nI mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) or \"Man of Steel\"(2013)? \"Fury\" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Pe\u00f1a). \r\n\r\n'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day \"Fury\" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), \"The Eagle has Landed\" (1976), \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); \"Fury\" is leagues better IMHO. \r\n\r\nThe melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of \"Fury,\" but I get the point of that sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-"

        "Awful in just about every regard. Acting was atrocious and although Bruce Willis's character is supposed to be a bit of alcoholic, I think the actor was actually drunk through most of this. Thomas Jane has only a few minutes of screen time but chews the scenery in what little in this he is and Cody Kearsley was pretty bland. Visual effects, even taking into account the low budget, was terrible. If not for Willis, this felt like a SyFy film. That said, never was angry while watching, in fact I laughed at some unintentional moments, just not enough to be in the good bad territory. **1.0/5**",
        "epicly ... terrible.\r\n\r\nI swear, Bruce Willis must just love acting because he has been in so many horrendous films. Word of advice: if the only name you know is Bruce Willis, it's probably going to be a very bad film."

Okay, the famous tank scene was perhaps a bit over the top but, what the hell, it\u2019s supposed to be an action film with a touch of comedy so...Naturally the so-called \"critics\" wrote it down, for instance on Rotten Tomatoes, but if you switch to the tab which shows what the actual audience said, it got a greater than 70% approval rating. IMDB also gives it a bit more than 7 stars out of 10 which I would say it\u2019s well worth.",

        "> Independently a fine movie rather being associated with TAKEN.\r\n\r\nActually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.\r\n\r\nThe first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.\r\n\r\nIt is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.\r\n\r\n6.5/10",
        "The rugged and feisty Liam Neeson (as on-screen alter ego ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills) is back in fighting form for a third and supposedly final go-around in \u2018Taken 3\u2032. This tired and tepid action-packed crime thriller is directed by French filmmaker Olivier Megaton (\u2018Taken 2\u2019, \u2018Transporter 3\u2019) with screenwriting credits attributed to \u2018Taken\u2019 producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Clearly Neeson and company want to squeeze the remaining strained juices out of the \u2018Taken\u2019 film franchise as this movie series trilogy ends on an exhausting whimper. Uninspired, toothless and motoring on empty impishness, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 has run its kinetic course for the aging Neeson to aim, shoot and take down some serious repetitive butt-kicking numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the last two energizing installments where flashy foreign locales were a major part of the appealing \u2018Taken\u2019 universe, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is reduced to unraveling in the uneventful backyard of familiar Los Angeles that definitely lacks the exotic excitement and visual vitality that were previously showcased in posh landscapes such as Paris and Istanbul. In fact, star Neeson reportedly nixed the idea to partake in the \u2018Taken 3\u2032 production if there was another concept of kidnapping involved. Huh? Why avoid the element of kidnapping when in fact it was the soundly running gimmick that made the \u2018Taken\u2019 experience palpable and pulsating? Still, this is the least of \u2018Taken 3\u2019s bothersome problems as the movie delves in the manufactured mockery involving cliched car chases, sketchy gunplay and the inclusion of countless Russian mobsters parading about in obligatory fashion. Importantly, even Neeson seems quite disengaged as his robotic Bryan Mills goes through the motions trying to find some upside in the forced upbeat shenanigans that seem to trudge along scene after scene.\r\n\r\nThe very first outing in \u2018Taken\u2019 took audiences by surprised as it featured a matured Neeson as an avenging former CIA human weapon Mills committed to his fatherly duties in manhandling the Albanian human traffickers that dared to abscond his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). In \u2018Taken 2\u2032, the hostile adversaries want Mills\u2019s head on a platter after he tore up their territory in his crusade to rescue his precious offspring from the opportunistic ruffians. Now Mills finds his neck on the line in the connection with his ex-wife Lenore\u2019s (Famke Janssen) brutal murder. Look out LA\u2026the harried Bryan Mills is out in survival mode. The question remains: whose blood will be spilled in the process?\r\n\r\nPrior to Lenore\u2019s senseless demise, she had visited her ex-hubby Bryan and the feelings between the former spouses are still strong. Mills still carries an emotional torch for Lenore but he cannot act upon his affections for her. Poor Lenore is trapped in her current unhappy marriage with an insufferable moneybags misfit Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). In the aftermath of Lenore\u2019s death, the distraught and beleaguered Mills finds out the trouble that he is embroiled in so convincingly. As a result of his former lover\u2019s slaughtering Bryan Mills is reeling with outrage. Yes, folks, it appears that Mills is on the run and must prove his innocence and bring to the forefront the murderers that butchered Lenore. Mills has on his mind the need to protect his exposed college-aged daughter Kim from potential harm as well.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the LAPD lead investigator in Franck Doltzer (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, \u2018The King Of Scotland\u2019) must track down the defiant Mills and make some sense out of the Lenore Mills St. John slaying.  Mills proves to be elusive and crafty as usual while leaving behind his trademark trashing of battered bodies and bouncing bullets in the chaotic southern California streets.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, the catchy novelty act of a hulking middle-aged Neeson exploding at the seams in action-oriented fashion resonated with glorious forethought. After all, \u2018Taken\u2019 single-handily resurrected Neeson\u2019s box office cred and made him a cinematic hipster to the young folks and his aged contemporaries alike.  However, the third time is not the charm in revisiting the gun-toting \u2018grandpa\u2019. Sadly, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is mindlessly played out as Neeson\u2019s Mills or the handlers behind this hollow hedonistic actioner have dipped their toes in an empty well of ideas to conclude this three-part crime caper.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face facts\u2026we all were \u2018Taken\u2019 in by this pseudo punchy action yarn that no longer generates the destructive heat it once punctuated with carefree confidence.\r\n\r\nTaken 3 (2015)\r\n\r\n29th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr.  49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Famke Jannssen, Maggie Grace and Dougray Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Olivier Megaton\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure/Crime thriller/Mystery and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)",
        "I was looking forward to this movie and I have to say that I was a wee bit disappointed. It is a decent enough action movie but the script leaves somewhat to be desired. A good chunk of the movie is quite good, actually it is very good, but there are some crucial scenes that, in my opinion, really drags it down to a rather mediocre level.\r\n\r\nThe plot is a fairly classical, not a very intelligent nor a very original, one. When trying to push the third sequel in a series Hollywood have a tendency to fall back on certain \u201ctrusted\u201d elements. Like, make the hero haunted by the law and / or the government (no I do not consider the government to be the same as the law) or kill off some of the main (or at least likable) characters.\r\n\r\nIn this movie they are doing both. I do not know why this always seems to be the standard solution because I certainly do not like it. Are the general movie going audience really falling for these, in my mind, cheap scripts? I guess they must be since this formula is repeated over and over again. Well, it is not for me to judge other peoples tastes and if I would have been a bean counter for the movie industry then it would really have been my duty to squeeze out as much money as possible regardless of whether I thought it would make a good movie or not, However, I am not. I am a consumer of movies and my personal opinion is that these plot elements are pretty cheap and not really to my liking. But then, that is just me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the movie is not really bad. It is a decent enough action movie and, in general, I quite like the performance of Liam Neeson. He is the half-sad, silent and, most of all, ass-kicking hero that I like. He is pretty much what holds this movie together. Well, that was perhaps not entirely fair. Forrest Whitaker is doing a quite good job as well. Most of the other characters are mostly fillers. The main bad guy started off fairly good but he really never got the chance to shine and the ending scenes with the big confrontation was\u2026well I would say pretty pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to my man gripe with this movie. Up until this point Liam Neeson was really playing the big bad, and really skilled, killing machine. The way he, with the help of his friends, entered the bad guy\u2019s stronghold was perhaps not very innovative (seen that, been there, and done that) but at least it was professional. After that however it turned into a bloody joke. Not only does our hero walk into a heavily defended stronghold carrying only a small pea shooter but every time he manages to liberate a decent weapon from the hopelessly incompetent bad guys he throws it away and, occasionally, picks up another pea shooter. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nThen we have the fairly ridiculous big fight at the end where the bad guy runs around in his underwear. That was just embarrassing. Maybe I could have swallowed the underwear thing if it was not for the fact that Lieam Neeson suddenly lost all kind of professionalism. Apart from the pea shooter syndrome mentioned before he just gets himself wacked by this maniac until, in the last minute, he miraculously recovers and gets the upper hand. There were a few minor glimpses of intelligence in the whole scene but they were never really exploited.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if would say this was a fairly decent and enjoyable action movie but I was expecting more from it. If the last third of the movie would have matched the first two thirds then my rating would have been higher. Maybe Liam Neeson is not a big enough star, although I like him a lot, to pick his roles like he wants to but I would say that he should indeed be a bit more picky and read the scripts before signing on.",
        "I can handle the 47 cuts and shakey cam poorly trying to hide the fact that Liam Neeson can't run. I can handle the inevitability of \"More money means more explosions!\" in franchises like these. I can even contort myself to handle the right-out-the-gate fridging of one of my favourite actresses that _Taken 3_ copped so much flak for. But what I cannot handle is how absolutely fucking dumb this movie gets in the second half. Every five minutes my roommate or I had to scream \"WHAT!?\" at the things that were happening on screen, and disparage the various idiotic and/or nonsense decisions that were being made.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"

        "Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Inglourious Basterds\" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless \u201cJew Hunter\u201d Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies except \u201cDeath Proof\u201d (2007). The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning M\u00e9lanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Br\u00fchl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino\u2019s other great movies (\u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cJackie Brown\u201d), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they\u2019re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer\u2019s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it\u2019s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",
        "Second time seeing this since it was released on Blu-ray in 2009 and still is a solid war-thriller with Tarantino's flair with dialogue and of course, feet. But seriously, despite being 2.5 hours, the time flew by thanks to the brisk pace and great performances from all around. Not my favorite Tarantino film but it's up there. **4.5/5**"

        "The special effects are great, the scenery and photography is lovely but the film is as a whole a big disappointment. You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn\u2019t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake, how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?\r\n\r\nA trillion dollar expedition to discover the \u201cmakers of mankind\u201d and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable way. Yeah, it looks okay so let\u2019s remove the helmets for instance? Right, apart from the immediate danger to your own health, what about quarantine procedures\u2026idiots?\r\n\r\nWhy did the robot put the mutagen in the drink? It\u2019s just illogical and never really adequately explained. Speaking of robots, robots have a power source and it\u2019s not spread all over them. If you rip their head of they do not continue to talk like nothing had happened. In the original Alien they at least had to hook him up to something. It goes on. The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth\u2019s actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?\r\n\r\nThis film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons.",
        "Although this is not a great movie, I was positively surprised, given the tons of bad references I got from this movie.\r\n\r\nThe background story is interesting and the cast is quite decent. Theron and Elba played well but specially remarkable are Rapace and Fassbender.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it does have many flaws in the script. Several characters are stupid beyond comprehension, several things are completely unexplained, Pearce character is really bad and the crashing of the alien spaceship is just ridiculous, as it is the killing of Theron's character.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it doesn't leave a bad after taste and I am looking forward to the continuation of the story."

        "This review contains **spoilers**.\r\nSo let\u2019s First get this out of The way I\u2019ve never been more frustrated, by people eating popcorn, fidgeting, & Coming in late. \r\n\r\nAnyways form the very start I had so many questions, how\u2019d they get here? Where\u2019d the Monster come from? Etc. And by the end I have no answers and even more questions. Are they gonna survive and kill all the Monsters? Is everyone else dead? Why\u2019d they think to have a baby? But that doesn\u2019t matter.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re just tossed into this situation with no explanation to almost anything. The only things we really know is of course making lond sounds means you\u2019re likely gonna die. And High Pitch Sounds Hurts the Monster. \r\n\r\nWish is a smart Choice and come to think of it is kinda obvious, maybe a little too obvious. Like how\u2019d they never think about that? Either way. \r\n\r\nA quick note for surviving other then the soundproofing here and there. Why not have a sound bomb of sorts, you could just throw? That would have toldy saved the Dad from having to sacrifice him self. \r\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say they\u2019re stupid they had many Smart decisions such a The sand paths, the box for the baby (wish was kinda sad), the little sound proof room, the Radio, and the fireworks. And that\u2019s just the sound related stuff the Lights and Fires Where also Smart.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the cast give us some incredible performances and lots of good chemistry. It probably helps that John and Emily are a real couple. Speaking of wich John Krasinski has Written and Directed a very clever and suspenseful horror film. I\u2019ve never been more scared of corn in my life. Also had jumped at water. \r\n\r\nAnd the sound department specifically the Foley Artist have never shined greater in any film I have ever seen before. The sound is a way flipped from most horror films as it\u2019s when the music drops and everything goes quiet that the Monster attacks. But not in this case everytime the Monster comes it\u2019s a big moment.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have nothing against a R rating. In fact I\u2019m somethimes more likely to see a film because of a R rating, it shows they have gus and they are willing to take a risk. F*ck you MPAA!!! \r\n\r\nAnyways some times all kinds of unnecessary crap is put in a Film because they like oh yeah we\u2019re rated R. Although that\u2019s not always needed this Film proves a well done PG-13 can still be dark and brutal. Killing a Child with in the first 10ish minuets, is a little dark. Although come on that kid had it Coming as soon as he grab those batteries. there\u2019s almost a bit of blood maybe the MPAA is pulling back on some things. Probably not those F*ck you MPAA!!!\r\n\r\nOk sorry my review is getting to become rated R. \ud83d\ude06\r\n\r\nAlso I wanted to note for whatever reason I enjoy films where I can count the entire cast.\r\n\r\nAlong side Get Out it seems people form comedy make better Horror film Directors then most Horror film Directors. It definitely makes sense though it\u2019s all about that timing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Short It was a gripping film from start to finish. I\u2019d highly recommend to all Horror and Thriller Fans. Although because of spoilers in this review you probably already saw it. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo leave a comment and let\u2019s discuss.\r\n\r\nNo likes",
        "**_No important spoilers here_**\r\n\r\nIn a **dystopic future**, the humanity has been severely smitten by strange blind creatures that feast on living flesh, both human and animal. In spite of being blind, the creatures have a super hearing and can identify sounds from far away. The creatures are nearly indestructible and very effective killers, and once they hear you, you are most likely dead.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows a surviving family trying to keep alive in this harsh reality. The movie setup is incredibly well-built to transpire the precaution, the constant fear, and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future. **The sound effects are awesome**, and the director can successfully use the nearly-constant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creatures.\r\n\r\nThe **acting is solid** and helps to immerse the watcher in the well-built plot.\r\n\r\nMy only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax, when we are not ready to stop watching it yet. **It could be 30 minutes longer** to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the ending.\r\n\r\nOverall, **an awesome movie**, well-thought and beautifully produced in every aspect.",
        "Every time a horror movie does something that I've never seen before, that gets me very excited. _A Quiet Place_ is such a movie. I do believe that maybe _A Quiet Place_ doesn't **quite** deserve the praise that it has received. Not that it isn't a good movie, just that said acclaims have been **so** high, to the point that I think maybe just the fact that it's original isn't enough to earn those laurels.\r\n\r\nI still am a fan of the movie, hardline, absolutely, just maybe a little underwhelmed given the reviews.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
        "This is far and away one of the best movies I have ever watched, and I've watched a lot of movies!  The story is original, no  small feat these days, and the acting is just outstanding!  John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the children, bring these characters to life, and make us really care, all without the benefit of well written dialogue.  That's not easy to do, but they do it.  Right from the start, you find yourself drawn into the lives of these people, and can feel the tension, the undercurrent of threat, that they live with every day.  Through all they face, we are also given a picture of a solid family, with a dad and mom doing everything possible to care for their children, the family praying together, holding onto faith even under the most difficult of circumstances, and that family dynamic really strengthens the entire story.  Who do you rely on when all is changed?  When everything goes wrong?  Family.  Along with the acting, the direction, sets, just everything, come together to deliver a truly scary movie, that doesn't rely on flash to terrify you.  Highly recommend this one.  We saw it in the theater, and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  Top notch work.",
        "This film is terrible. How this pathetic excuse for entertainment has any rating is a mystery. It's an insult to art of film making and to the people who love cinema. Nobody in their right mind would suggest watching this hole ridden, ham acted, utter nonsense themed non-story movie to anybody. Save yourself the hassle, trust me, it's bad.",
        "_**Decent horror flick, but the family members make too many exasperating blunders**_\r\n\r\nA family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape. The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).  \r\n\r\n\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind \u201cSigns\u201d (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of \u201cAlien/Aliens\u201d with the extraterrestrials of \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (2005). They\u2019re basically a knock-off of the monster in \u201cCloverfield\u201d (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome. I love the tone, however, as well as Emily Blunt and the sumptuous Hudson River-area locations.     \r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the state of New York, about 50-65 miles north of the Big Apple (Beacon, Pawling & New Paltz), except for Little Falls, which is another 110 miles northwest.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-",
        "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEver since Jordan Peele shocked everyone with his feature directorial debut, Get Out, no one else questioned the potential that a well-known comedic actor could bring to the horror genre. Therefore, I vividly remember discovering that John Krasinski was directing, writing, and starring in a low-budget, original horror flick and feeling incredibly interested, to the point of considering it one of my most anticipated movies of the respective year. I absolutely adore the actor's memorable performance in The Office, but I never really saw anything worth noting from him after that show. Adding Emily Blunt (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow) - her \"slightly more famous\" wife - was definitely an attention-grabbing move, especially when the young actors were still unknown at the time of release.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski developed a screenplay based on a relatively simple yet highly impactful, imaginative premise. Creepy, scary monsters who hunt by sound isn't exactly a mind-blowing story aspect, but the extreme amount of tension and suspense transform a regular theater session into a nail-biting, nerve-wracking cinematic experience. Fortunately, the audience at my first screening was really invested in the film, which made for a truly unforgettable moment that I know some people didn't have due to disrespectful moviegoers. However, if there's one thing no one can take away from A Quiet Place is that it works just as well or better watching at home with the lights out in the silence of our own house.\r\n\r\nSome viewers might look at this movie solely as an entertaining horror film with effective jumpscares, shock value, and cool monsters, which are all great attributes. However, the reason why everything works so well is indisputably due to the profoundly well-explored family. Thematically, parenthood and family love are subjects that Krasinski and his team of writers deeply expand upon, primarily through the father-daughter relationship. Being a parent is seen by many as a daunting task, filled with the inevitable fear of not being considered a good father or mother. Lee and Regan's (Millicent Simmonds) difficulties in understanding each other are not only remarkably relatable, but their bond also contributes to some of the most emotional scenes of the movie.\r\n\r\nLee and Evelyn only desire to keep their children safe, but when the world is packed with merciless creatures that kill if a pin drops, some details like having a deaf daughter certainly don't help their mission. They do, however, dial up the levels of tension and suspense to their maximum. Krasinski shows tremendous skill as the director by delivering excruciatingly suspenseful build-ups and exceptionally effective scares. His ability to drastically change the entire mood of a scene offers the viewers several genuinely captivating sequences. Horror-wise, there's plenty to enjoy. From creative atmospheric sequences to jaw-dropping, shocking plot points, A Quiet Place has something for everyone.\r\n\r\nI've addressed Krasinski's work as both director and writer, but he also offers what I believe to be his career-best performance in a feature film. Both he and Emily Blunt perfectly capture the terrifying feeling of living in a post-apocalyptic environment. The protection of their children carries overwhelming despair of losing them to the visually distinct monsters, and both actors shine in their roles. However, my personal standout is Simmonds (Wonderstruck) and Noah Jupe (Honey Boy, Ford v Ferrari). Both were unknown young actors at the original release date, but they steal the spotlight from the big stars. Jupe proves that he has everything to become an Oscar-winner - the demand for him is exponentially rising - and Simmonds delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen from a real-life deaf actress, bringing a great deal of authenticity to her display.\r\n\r\nAll incorporate their characters seamlessly. The interactions between the adult and young actors feel as realistic and honest as possible, also due to the beautifully written screenplay. Technically, I must praise the phenomenal work done with such a low budget. All the way from the shooting location to the sound department, it truly feels like every single person had an essential role in the making of this movie. Not even the monsters are at fault, and there are a couple of close-ups that could have easily been awful, but the VFX artists really step up to the plate and deliver wonderfully horrific creatures. It's well-edited (Christopher Tellefsen), well-shot (Charlotte Bruus Christensen), and the score (Marco Beltrami) is employed just at the right moments.\r\n\r\nI only have one major issue with the film. Story-wise, even though the audience is placed in a fictional world, it feels so real that it's hard to ignore a couple of logical questions regarding the fate of the rest of humanity. These nitpicks don't really bother me, but the ending of the movie still doesn't sit well with me after many viewings. Without spoiling it, of course, the very last shot feels like a cry to Hollywood to make a sequel, which I have to admit is somewhat disappointing. Finally, a film that doesn't belong to cinematic universes or titanic franchises focuses on telling an engaging story with characters worth investing our time on\u2026 all to end in a slightly out-of-character moment so more movies can be made?\r\n\r\nA Quiet Place remains emotionally impactful, as well as incredibly suspenseful and tense, even after multiple viewings. Boasting a concept so unique yet so simple, John Krasinski and his fellow co-writers create a profoundly well-explored, character-driven horror story packed with relatable family issues and impressive performances across the board. Through justified shock value and surprisingly investing non-verbal dialogues, this film is one more piece of evidence that the best horror emerges from remarkable character building. The popular actor also proves to be a phenomenal director, generating extreme suspense quickly, drastically altering the entire atmosphere of a scene seamlessly. Technically, it genuinely feels like a low-budget flick where every single department has a noticeable impact on the final product, but the menacing, distinct-looking CGI monsters do steal the spotlight. Despite a few logical issues and an ending that feels more corporate than indie, my love for this movie continues intact. Hopefully, its sequel won't be a disappointment.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
        "**Works for a normal audience, not for critical thinkers**\r\n\r\nAlmost an 8/10 on a different, shabbier, online movie database with almost 14 hundred reviews at the point of this review written. The hype is distorting the ratings of this movie, like the script is distorting the physical laws of sound. A creature film should not be hard to make, and the producers here had the budget, the special effects and the actors to do something interesting. Unfortunately suspending disbelief is impossible when nothing makes sense and so many questions are left unanswered. How can a pitiful monster like that overthrow mankind? Where is the power coming from? Not a single sound trap in the whole film? Did she turn off the faucet eventually? The creatures can come and go inside the shelter without breaking anything down (which you would hear)? But the humans did not prepare silent exits in their home? What even happened? And there is no story. The creatures come, humans make some sounds, they don't even fight, end of movie. It's like watching a boxing match with one guy weighing double the other, then last round the same guy weighs only half the other. How cheap and boring, I want to scream the screenwriter in his moronic ear. Disappointing and anti-climatic.\r\n\r\n27 June 2018\r\n\r\nI am migrating my reviews from a different site which has become simply garbage. TMDB looks awesome and I look forward to be a part of it."

        "Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington, Jared Leto, and Remi Malik star in the new thriller \u201cThe Little Things\u201d and combine to make very gripping and memorable performances.\r\n\r\nThe script was reportedly written over thirty years ago by John Lee Hancock who has gone on to write, direct, and produce multiple films of note in the decades since he first created the screenplay.\r\nThe film is set in 1990 and involves a cop named Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), who travels from his small California town to Los Angeles to get information on a suspect.\r\n\r\nJoe has a history in L.A as he used to be a homicide detective for the department which combined with his meltdown while obsessing over a murder case has caused him more than a bit of notoriety.\r\n\r\nJim Baxter (Remi Malik) is the hotshot new Detective who has been leading the investigation into a string of unsolved murders. Joe accompanies Jim to a new crime scene and notes some similarities with his unsolved case.  Joe takes some personal days and begins to do some legwork on the case and reports his findings to Jim which causes Joe to remember aspects of what drove him to his marital, health, and career issues as he is unable and unwilling to let the case drop.\r\n\r\nWhen a prime suspect no longer fits into the picture; suspicions fall on a crime enthusiast named Albert (Jared Leto) who seems to check all the boxes but is also taking delight in winding up Joe which causes Jim to question if he is a viable suspect or just an oddball who gets off on crimes and winding up the cops but does not actually commit any offenses.\r\n\r\nAs the delicate dance unfolds between the characters the fact that this is an era before Cell Phones, DNA tests, GPS, and elaborate computer networks helps underscore the plight of the officers. If the film was set in a modern setting much of the suspense and uncertainty of the story and characters would be moot thanks to technology. \r\n\r\nAs the game of cat and mouse unfolds between the characters Jim learns how a person can become obsessed with a case and Joe attempts to mentor him from the success and failures of his life which includes some gray areas.\r\nAside from the strong performances and engaging story what makes \u201cThe Little Things\u201d work is that it is a film that does not take the Hollywood fallbacks of extended gunfights, car chases, and over the top action scenes. What it does show is real and flawed characters that are doing what they think are right and does not attempt to wrap things up nice and tidy.\r\n\r\nThe film uses the element of doubt to not only drive the story but the actions of the characters which underscores that an element of uncertainty exists in some investigations and in with the resources available to police at the time; things are not always certain.\r\n\r\nThe film will appear in cinemas and HBO Max and is a compelling and well-crafted thriller that is not to be missed.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",
        "Okay movie made watchable thanks to Washington, Malek and to some extent Leto. Is a bit slow so does take a bit of patience to get to the end, but it's worth checking out. In addition, this is a movie that deserves the straight-to-streaming treatment and not pay to see in theaters. **3.0/5**",
        "'The Little Things' is a diversion - not the worst way to kill two hours, and definitely a movie with some people in it. It's a shame there isn't more to recommend about it.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-little-things-three-oscar-winners-one-so-so-mystery",
        "\u201cThe Little Things\u201d is such a by-the-book police procedural drama that the film doesn\u2019t stand out much. It could be just another season of \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d or could run together in your memory with dozens of similar crime movies from the last 30 years. The story is familiar, but the ridiculous amount of talent from the Oscar winning cast helps to slightly elevate this routine material.\r\n\r\nVeteran sheriff Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) teams up with police Sergeant Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) to search for a serial killer who\u2019s murdering women in the Los Angeles area. With the body count rising, the men begin to focus on a suspect named Albert (Jared Leto), a disturbing and unbalanced man who enjoys toying with the cops. The men go to great lengths to uncover the guilty party, but the investigation brings up a dark history that uncovers some of Deacon\u2019s long-buried secrets.\r\n\r\nIn terms of psychological crime thrillers, there\u2019s nothing new here. The plot is uncomplicated and direct, and even the surprise reveal isn\u2019t unexpected. Washington is the ideal casting choice as Deacon. He\u2019s a reliable old timer, and there aren\u2019t many actors like him who are working today. He plays well against Malik\u2019s understated brooding, and both are no match for Leto. He\u2019s great at creating crazed psychopath characters, selling the role as an unhinged killer right down to the most intimidating physical mannerisms. The cast is the film\u2019s strongest point.\r\n\r\nDirector John Lee Hancock makes the awful choice to score scenes with 60\u2019s rock and roll, which is almost as off-putting as the distracting, choppy editing. There are depictions of crime scenes that are gruesome and distressing, giving the film an unsettling vibe. The overall atmosphere is unpleasant, and the film ultimately feels pointless.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Little Things\u201d isn\u2019t a total dud by any means, but it\u2019s not one of the best examples of the genre. The screenplay (by Hancock) is written for those who enjoy disciplined crime dramas, and it should satisfy fans who aren\u2019t expecting too much.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",
        "Good actors. Ok pacing. Storyline somewhat disjointed and unbelieveable at times. Poor ending.",
        "Boasting some of the worst editing of the last couple of years, John Lee Hancock (The Highwaymen) delivers a Se7en's copycat narrative that lacks the overall interest and impact of the classic film. Despite good performances from the (type)cast, the supposedly mysterious, suspenseful story surrounding a serial killer is just another variation of the same formula people have seen hundreds of times.\r\n\r\nCharacters, relationships, and plot points are far from compelling, making the whole movie feel extremely forced and somewhat predictable. With no surprise factor and zero innovative developments, the overextended runtime simply becomes heavier and heavier...\r\n\r\nAn utter waste of remarkable actors.\r\n\r\nRating: D"

        "Alongside _Weekend_ and _Moonlight_, _Call Me By Your Name_ is the greatest queer film I have seen in the past ten years. It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\r\n\r\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\r\n\r\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning.",
        "A near-perfect, timeless movie which will be responsible for many tears and yeast infections. Languid small-town living is captured perfectly, as is the tentative romance between the leads. I can't think of any substantive criticism until the last 25 minutes, when the movie becomes sloppy, less of a climax than a dissipation. (And personally, I'd have liked to see a sliver more of sexuality, which is oddly lacking.) Still, it's good. Watch it."

Don't expect the movie to deliver on the many promises it makes though, they cut the last 10 minutes of film too early. That's my biggest gripe with it and why I wouldn't give this a higher rating.",
        "Warrior was the most exciting, detailed and emotional movie I saw. It had action, drama & descent cast.\r\n\r\nIt dwelve into the backstory for each character:\r\nBrendan resented his father for being an abusive alcoholic, and made a life for himself and his family. He cares for his family too much to let them lose their home, and so he goes back to MMA sport to win a few money. But circumstances had gave Brendan the oppertunity to win big at the Sparta tournament. Once there, mhe comes face to face with his brother.\r\nTommy is another side of the coin; he has so much anger in him; he blames his father for the past and blames his brother for abandoning him and their dying mother. But he made a new family in the Marine Corp, for which he enlisted, particuraly one marine who called brother, who was killed in a friendly fire. Tommy then desserted his regiment and decided to enter the Sparta tournament to win a prize money as a promise to his friend's family (this shows that he does have a kinder side, even for a biref moment). He turns to his father to train him, but still resenting him for the past. But near the end, he sees his father relapsed and drunk (as drunk as he was in the past) and seeing how sad it all looks, Tommy realised he wasted all that anger over a broken down drunk and (may implied) forgave him (which was a sweet moment).\r\nPaddy is the father to Brendan and Tommy, but he lost them both (and his wife) when he was an abusive alcoholic. He regretted his actions and went sober. He tries yet fails to reconcile with both sons for the past. While Brendan had fogiven him (but don't trust him), Tommy still held that anger. Eventually, Paddy became heartbroken that Tommy will never forgive him and so he relapsed and got drunk. This inadvertantly changed Tommy's perspective his of father. In the end, Paddy looked on with pride as his sons reconciled.\r\n\r\nI really liked the ending of the film, where the two brothers, Tommy and Brendan, went face-to-face. And right near the end, it was really emotional, when the brothers finally let go of the past.\r\n\r\nThis film was really amazing. It was just terrific!"

        "The Mercenary with a mouth is back with the eagerly awaited arrival of \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d. The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).  When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.\nHis first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.\n\nOne would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.\nUndaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.\n\nWhat follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.\nMy biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.\n\nThis time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.\nThey also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion.  What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to \u201cfix\u201d various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.\n\nI cannot wait to see what comes next as \u201cDeadPool 2\u201d is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.\n\n4 stars out of 5",
        "An utterly hilarious movie, with hundreds of pop culture references. A movie that doesn't take itself seriously, creating a silly, yet sensible dynamic. A must watch!",
        "All in all, I prefer a Marvel movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but the nonstop unseriousness of Deadpool 2 can wear you down, too.",
        "Terminator + Adam Sandler = Deadpool 2. Anyone else notice that? Even Deadpool calls Cable Jon Connor but the whole movie is structured like a Terminator movie. Cable is like a combination of Jon Connor and a Terminator. All the comedy is styled just like an Adam Sandler movie. And that is it. Works pretty good oddly. It is the Terminator movie that never was. Though the director of the first Deadpool wasn't directing this movie he is actually directing the next Terminator film.",
        "Takes some pretty hardcore departures from the first movie in terms of characters, but _Deadpool 2_ is still funny as Hell (maybe not quite as funny as it thinks but still, very very humorous) and Ryan Reynolds once again absolutely nails the titular role. I never loved either of these movies as much as it seems people did by and large, but I do **like** them, and that's not nothin'.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
        "I have to say that I quite enjoyed this movie. Was there a lot of juvenile jokes? Oh yes. Was the characters sometimes over the top and silly? Yes again. Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a\u2019la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\r\n\r\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\r\n\r\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she\u2019s hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\r\n\r\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\r\n\r\nThe team of fellow mutant \u201cwarriors\u201d that Deadpool pulled together? Well let\u2019s say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat \u201cexpendable\u201d but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought \u201cWhat the f\u2026?\u201d and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually."

        "An other great master peace has been added the the Lord of The Rings collection. This movie was an excellent example of how great actors, an amazing story and a beautiful world can be produced in such an excellent way. Peter Jackson has out done his self by creating this great film. There are differences from the book but I can't complain about any of them, yes I love the original story but this one is still one of the best. All in all a amazing movie.",
        "Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien's tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon's critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien's The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film's framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy's star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it's Freeman's show, and he's as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film's main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it's a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who's seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I'm an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It's astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn't mind it in the least. I believe it's because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy's \"save the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo's neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn't have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It's rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film's rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can't stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn't mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon's newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they're fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I'll most assuredly enjoy the ride.",
        "Of course off the level of its <em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> predecessors, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed <em>'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'</em>.\r\n\r\nIt has good lure to it, the plot is more than interesting, it features pleasant callbacks and - like LOTR - looks exquisite. As for the casting, I like 'em. Martin Freeman (Bilbo) is, like Elijah Wood, an actor I've always found hit-and-miss, but I really did enjoy Freeman's performance here - the humour is his usual schtick, though the rest of his showing is strong.\r\n\r\nIan McKellen (Gandalf) returns and is as much a joy to watch as before. None of the others, though all good, stand out massively, James Nesbitt (Bofur) does bring decent comedic stuff.\r\n\r\nHopefully the two sequels to this are just as fantastic!"

        "I am amazed by how many people on IMDb that have given this movie 8, 9 and even 10 stars. It\u2019s perhaps not the worst movie I\u2019ve seen but it is in no way worth that kind of rating.\r\n\r\nThe good part of the movie is Liam Neeson who makes an enjoyable performance with the script that he was given. He is pretty much the reason that I gave it as much as 4 IMDb stars. The rest of the film is just plain wrong.\r\n\r\nMy first impression is, god this director likes film grain! Now this is a matter of taste of course but I don\u2019t like when movies have artificially been made to look like they were filmed on old and crappy film. It has its places but it didn\u2019t add anything here.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off with a plane crash which is not done very good. Neither in terms of special effects nor in terms of realism.\r\n\r\nThe lack of realism, unfortunately, continues throughout the movie. The behavior of the wolves is utterly unnatural and unrealistic. I can live with this if it\u2019s a horror movie or some other fantasy movie but this is not supposed to be that. The actual footage of the wolves is rather mediocre as well.\r\n\r\nThen there is this so called experienced hunter and \u201cwolf expert\u201d. Leaving the crash site is a dubious decision to say the least. Then we got the jumping of cliffs with a flimsy home made rope instead of just walking a bit further to get down not to mention making ammunition go off by poking wooden sticks at it, what the f\u2026? In addition the guy knows nothing about wolves, or any other wild animal for that matter.\r\n\r\nJust to add to this not so enjoyable experience, the film has an utterly lousy ending.",

Would I be instantly dismembered? Sure, but you get that on the big jobs.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"

Much of the story felt like it was just forced to setup a shot or scene which does hurt it. It isn't a perfect movie but I'd watch it again. It is like Indiana Jones meets Silent Hill. None of the character actors felt out of place or superficial either, I really appreciate that. Everyone felt believable and natural to their roles and environment, not forced.",
        "Horror is baaaaack! \r\nAnd with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is not for people that don\u2019t like horror movies or burnt out on them. Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I\u2019ve read several critic reviews were they just don\u2019t get it. They use words to describe it like \u201cusing every trick in the horror trope\u201d or \u201cpredictable\u201d, \u201cthrowing the kitchen sink at\u201d, or \u201cnot enough character development\u201d. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you\u2019d expect. \r\n\r\nOkay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?\r\n\r\nBeing the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demi\u00e9n Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn\u2019t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn\u2019t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.\r\n\r\nFather Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. \r\n\r\nYes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don\u2019t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. \r\nDirector Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.\r\n\r\nWhat this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon\u2019s name is Valak\u2013an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. \r\nIf you are expecting character development then you\u2019re not going to find it here. This story doesn\u2019t need a lot of characters at all. You don\u2019t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he\u2019s behind the character\u2019s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It\u2019s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. \r\n\r\nFather Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you\u2019ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn\u2019t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.\r\n\r\nWhat also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.\r\n\r\nI give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.\r\nIf I were to rate its place among the other films in The Conjuring universe, I would rate as follows\r\n\r\n1) The Conjuring\r\n2) The Conjuring 2\r\n3) The Nun\r\n\r\n* 4) Annabelle Creation",
        "I wanted to like this movie because it's connected to Conjuring movies, but it was awful, even from the start it was obvious.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, boring movie with cheap jump scares. The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 3, because it was shot nicely and acting wasn't that bad.",
        "The Nunjuring!\r\n\r\nWhen a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate...\r\n\r\nSo here we have the latest spin-off from the one time high quality \"Conjuring\" franchise. Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, \"The Nun\" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... \r\n\r\nThe set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the \"Warren\" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about \"bringing something new to the table\", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from \"Annabelle: Creation\" and is tonally compliant.\r\n\r\nThis formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on \"The Woman In Black\", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10",
        "Not the literal **worst** entry in the series (that laurel still rests firmly upon the crown of _Annabelle_) and there was a couple of cool design moments, like creepy hands busting out of statues, even the acting is of acceptable level. But that's about everything positive I can say for _The Nun_, 'cause this is pretty dang bad. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"
